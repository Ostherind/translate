Кайто пидор
Workers, minerals, vespene gas, and a command center. I start out every match with only these resources at my disposal. It's my job to turn them into something that can defeat my opponent.
Generally, that means I need to build structures capable of training units for my army. My build order determines how my end of the matchup plays out.
This game, I've opted for a quick hellion attack. Not only will it offer me a chance to deal some damage to my opponent, but it will also allow me to scout.
But it seems I don't have much to worry about. My opponent went for a greedy build order—focusing entirely on his economy instead of his army.
Unfortunately for him, the match isn't going to last long enough for that risk to pay off. My hellions make short work of his single queen and handful of zerglings.
With his frontline out of the way, I'm free to rush into his mineral line and roast his workers, denying him the resources he needs to muster an army.
Facing down a marine reinforcement, it's not long before my zerg opponent types out the two letters: GG. Easy.
I haven't gone up against a player as strong as Accel in a while. There probably wasn't a single person at the VSL qualifier at his level.
That only makes a potential victory all the more tantalizing. It's a chance to prove to myself that I've got what it takes.
Even if I've decided on playing standard, I've still got a decision to make in how to execute my mid-game strategy.
This map is well-suited for a hellion attack. I'll have plenty of room to poke around his expansion since it lacks a choke point.
An attack by air might also be a strong option. The distance between our bases is relatively long by land, but it'll take a banshee less than five seconds to travel from mine to his.
I'm confident with both styles. It's just a matter of how I want to execute the attack.
I produce my hellions two at a time and send my first four across the map.
It takes a few extra seconds to clear out the space between our bases. Confident that I have enough breathing room, I prepare for my first attack.
My hellions make a beeline for his natural expansion's worker line. With some decent micro on my part, I manage to secure a few worker kills before ordering a retreat.
A lesser player might have sacrificed four hellions for more economic damage. But I've practiced this style enough to know that I'll lose map control without them.
I cut all extraneous unit production to get out a banshee as soon as possible. The earlier I'm able to hit, the less chance that Accel will have the right defenses.
With my banshee en route, I clear out the path to his base with a handful of marines. Denying information to my opponent is important, even if I don't plan to attack from that blind spot.
It seems to have been the right choice, as his marines are out of position when my banshee arrives at his base. I manage to secure a few worker kills before ordering a retreat.
Since I didn't lose my banshee, Accel has to spend minerals on air defense. Knowing that, I prepare to transition to a full-on ground army.
This game is going insanely well. Though Accel took his expansion before I did, the damage he took puts us on even footing.
I follow up with an army of marines, marauders, and dropships: the bread and butter of most terran players.
Since I cleared the space between our bases, he's in the dark about the timing of this next attack. There's a solid chance that I could do enough damage here to end the game!
But just as I arrive at the outskirts of Accel's expansion, one of his dropships uploads a handful of marines in my base. Tch, that's going to slow down my ability to reinforce.
Woah! Shit! With my focus on the drop in my main, Accel rushed into the army I left outside of his base while I wasn't paying attention. He's got a concave formation on me!
And just like that, my advantage evaporates. Though I manage to stay in the game for a bit longer, Accel wisely guards his lead by immediately taking a third base.
Soon enough, his economic advantage is reflected in the size of his army. After my blunder, Accel's play was airtight. There really wasn't anything for me to do.
With a groan, I offer a gg and concede the match.
Game after game is a beatdown. I can't crack her defenses when I attack, and I'm barely holding on when she goes on offense.
She's just as unforgiving in pointing out my mistakes as she is in-game.
Your wall at the ramp to your natural is trash. How the hell do you get away with this? You're asking to get busted.
It's not something I really think about that much. I just throw it up, you know?
Fix it or be punished.
That probably isn’t an idle threat. Jett is the type of player capable of ending the game instantly if she can capitalize on the right kind of mistake.
Her style has been characterized as both passive and reactive. She takes her time and watches her opponents, patient for the right moment to strike. She only takes a risk if it’s calculated in her favor.
Given her former success, the style has suited her well. Though I can’t help but wonder why she hasn’t lately been performing at her previous level. Maybe she’s lost her killer instinct?
Guess not. A reminder of the skill difference between us rushes up the ramp to my natural expansion and crushes my wall, as promised.
In the aftermath of the destruction, she swarms my base and seizes an easy win. Jett revels in her victory with a predatory smile.
Wrecked.
If the idea behind practicing against a good player is to improve, I should probably play standard.
Still the temptation to all-in is always there. How sick would it be to grab a quick win on a KPGA player?
It’s probably best that I follow Jett's advice. I opt for a standard macromanagement game, this guy’s build permitting.
I take my natural expansion and begin teching up. The match progresses quietly with only a few brief skirmishes with his stalkers and my marines.
My scan show that he's not doing anything out of the ordinary. One of us has to make a move sooner or later.
I start constructing my starport and researching my bio upgrades. I’m surprised to find that they finish without any pressure coming from the protoss army.
This could be a good time to go for some drop play and try to snipe some of his critical tech buildings.
If I were to play an aggressive drop style, I need to be confident in my control and in the fact that I can outplay him.
On the other hand, this game has been exceptionally quiet. If I could get up another expansion, I’ll have a serious economic advantage going into the late game.
Screw it, I'm not in the mood for macro.
I place two early barracks mid-map, just outside his scouting path. With luck, he won’t see my strategy until it’s coming at him.
My heart pounds as I watch my marine count grow. He still hasn’t scouted my all-in.
This is a huge advantage. I've got this.
I bring my marines to his base and charge up the ramp leading to his high ground. I leave an SCV on the low ground to construct a bunker just in case I have to fall back.
He retreats with his lone zealot and begins to chronoboost something out of his gateway, likely a stalker. He still hasn’t pulled his probes, so I start heading towards the mineral line.
Shit! He preemptively pulled a handful of probes and hid them out of my vision! With my exit cut off, I won't be able to escape!
Things look even worse when he gets his first stalker out. He might actually hold this!
I do everything I can salvage the situation, but it's too late. The single marine I manage to get into my bunker is useless at this point. From the low ground, I can’t do any damage to his units.
My attack was completely routed. Even though he didn't scout out the rush, he defended without breaking a sweat.
I cut marines long enough to save up for a quick third base. It finishes before my first dropship is even out.
Just as my expansion finishes constructing, a red blip shows up on my minimap. Is it a void ray? I have missile turrets to defend, so I should be fine.
Wait no...it's floating on the outskirts of my base. A warp prism? He’ll be be able to warp his units into my base! My army is completely out of position!
He starts warping in just outside of my static defenses. Zealots rush into my base and tear my mineral line to pieces before I can move units back to defend. This is bad.
Oh god, he's at my natural too? He’s got such a big army! I can’t keep my defenses up with my economy crippled.
I spread myself way too thin. Ugh. If only I had done a better job scouting.
With my production structures camped, my units die almost the second they finish training. That's checkmate.
Dropship play is a defining characteristic of a top terran player. If I win with this, it's a good indication that I can stand toe-to-toe with the best players in Korea.
It's time to put my practice to work. I gather enough units for an attack at my starport as the first dropship finishes.
It's imperative he doesn't see me move out, so I make sure the watch towers are clear and avoid places where protoss players commonly leave their observers.
When my dropships are in the clear, I fly straight into his base. He's unprepared for the attack, and I unload all my units rush to snipe some important tech buildings.
With the damage to his infrastructure done, my units retreat for the safety of my dropship. That set him back a ton.
The game is going incredibly well, so I decide to pull back on my aggression and build up an army for a final push.
He's been too busy defending to get a decent standing army, and when I roll in with my amassed units...
... he kites back, bobbing and weaving away from my forces while delivering potshots.
I give chase, the taste of victory tantalizingly close. I manage to corner his army, leaving him with nowhere to run.
But just as I move in to deliver to final blow…
He flanks me with a half dozen templar, showering my army in high-damage storms! I pull back frantically, but my army is left in tatters!
I try my hardest to gather enough units to mount a second offensive, but he continues to crush my attacks with only a handful of well-upgraded and well-microed zealots, stalkers and archons.
How the hell did this happen? My lead is gone!
Frustrated, I box all of my workers and charge towards his base for a final attack. With my SCVs on the frontlines, I should have enough power to take a direct engagement.
I roll through his fourth base uncontested! Yes! He’s giving up ground because he knows he can’t face me!
Emboldened, I drive up ramp leading to his natural to end the game…
... And find myself face to face with an ambush. My frontline evaporates before I can issue the command to retreat, and he crushes what remains of my army a few moments later.
I can’t believe it. I lost.
I stare blankly at the screen for almost ten seconds before I finally type gg and quit out of the match.
Cannons, two-gate, four-gate, blink, proxy robo, proxy stargate. There are a dozen different ways that Stunt could end this game early.
As a precaution, I scout around the interior of my base to ensure that I'm not being cannon rushed.
And, as I discover, I am. Just outside my vision range and dangerously close to my worker line, a cannon finishes building.
Some losses in a defense are inevitable, but if I handle this well it should put me ahead of Stunt.
It's gutsy of him to risk a best of one on a strategy like this. Practically all I have to do is scout it to score a victory.
By microing my injured SCVs away from cannon shots, I'm able to end the rush at a low cost. In truth, that seemed like an exceptionally weak attack. Was Accel hyping this kid up for nothing?
I end up only losing three of my workers by the time his single cannon is dead. Now, where's that probe...
There it is. With his probe down, there's no way he'll be able to drop down anymore cannons.
Still, he's probably planning his next move. I have to decide what comes next.
If he's transitioning into something standard, this would be the perfect time to counter-attack.
His tech has to be lacking, so there's no way he'll have strong enough units to defend a marine attack.
And while it seems incredibly unlikely, there's always a chance that he might have another attack ready.
If I want to err on the side of caution, I could stay in my base and simply tech up. But that might give him enough time to get back into the game.
I should make this call based on what I know about his playstyle.
I don't want to give Stunt enough time to get back on his feet. Without applying some kind of pressure, he could easily take a blind risk and put us on even footing.
His cross-map position is guaranteed due to the map's version--
Woah, shit! Zealots?! How?!
--- And again! I took my eyes off of my main army long enough that it ran into cannons positioned at the top of Stunt's choke point!
I try desperately to pull my units back in time to defend, but the damage is done.
With my economy completely eviscerated and his base well-fortified, I have no way to stay in the game.
Even though I'm giving up a chance to win the game immediately, the safe thing to do is tech up to dropships.
... But it looks like I won't need to. My precautionary scout uncovers an ambush waiting in a dark corner of my base.
With more than enough units and space to micro my marines, I dispatch his zealots with barely any losses.
A cannon rush feint into a proxy gate? Absolutely ridiculous.
With his rush routed, Stunt quits out of the game without a gg.
I won. With surprising ease, too.
Alright. Time to show Reva and everyone else that's watching what I'm made of.
I'm watching my scout cross the map when a thought occurs to me. If this guy supposedly hates rushes, I should be able to score a pretty easy win against him with one.
There's a specific proxy build that works really well on this map, especially against the type of player that Accel described Reva as. I might risk angering the person I'm trying to recruit, though.
Still, the game is being broadcast online. If I win, there's a chance that I could earn enough cred to find another player anyway.
Do I really want to go against Accel's advice? It's only one game, after all.
Why should I have to play out some hour long snore-fest just because Reva doesn't like being cheesed? It's a part of the game, whether he likes it or not.
I divert my scouting SCV's path to the bottom corner of my opponent's natural expansion. With luck, he won't see this until it's too late.
Proxy marauder is an incredibly strong build against anyone who expands early, but I could even do damage on the off-chance that he doesn't wall off entirely.
With my early gas and mineral production all devoted to this attack, I find myself in a promising position when my first marauder surges from the barracks.
Hah, command center first. He built an expansion before producing even a single unit. Punished.
I throw down a bunker at the bottom of my opponent's ramp,
 and he immediately follows suit. But he has absolutely no chance to defend without an army to his name.
I waltz my marauder up the ramp just in time to watch his first marine scramble from a barracks and rush towards his bunker. But before he can get there, my marauder picks him off.
... And just like that, the game ends. Reva quit out of the match without a single word.
Ergh. It's not like I hate playing standard or anything, I just don't like that I'm playing straight into this guy's strong point. Whatever.
As expected, the game begins with a long calm. Reva shows absolutely no sign of early aggression, instead focusing entirely on building a strong economy.
I use the breathing room to invest heavily into structures for tank production.
My scout reveals that Reva's doing the same thing. Just as Accel said, looks like it's going to be a long, drawn out tank vs. tank positioning war.
Reva and I split the map in half, one side littered with his bases, defensive structures and tanks, and one side with mine.
I'm not particularly comfortable with this style of play. I prefer an agile army accompanied by dropships, but it's next to impossible to break a meching terran if they have a strong economy.
Well, I need to start thinking about my next move. Even though my center map position--
Woah! Shit, I'm under attack!
Reva's inching his tank line towards the center of the map. He managed to find a weak position in my formation-- one of my tanks was a bit too far away from the rest, and it got picked off.
A nuke?! In a serious game?!
Not here...
Not here either! Where's the nuke?! Shit, I need to catch it before I lose my army!
Boom! There's the ghost.
Phew. I managed to catch it before the nuke went off. Alright, with that threat out of the way, I can get back to addressing the tank line
Oh.
Spawning in at the 7 o’clock position for Team Crash is the blue protoss player, JangL!
His opponent from Team KaiNE at the 2 o’clock base is Shing!
Protoss vs. Protoss, close positions. This match won’t last long.
Mirror matchups are so stupid. PvP most of all.
You don’t know the intricacies. It can sometimes be really intense!
Literally every strategy is a coinflip. PvP should be considered gambling and made illegal.
PvP usually ends with both players on one base. The decision to expand is often too great of a risk, especially with the players as close as they are.
Moreso than in any other matchup, mind games are essential to securing an advantage.
Reach too far with aggression against a balanced strategy, you lose. Go middle of the road against a tech build, you lose. Tech up against an attack, you lose.
Yaaaaah! JangL and Shing both have opted for a four warpgate strategy!
Prepare to watch these two clash! It will all come down to their control!
... Or, that. That can happen too.
Even with Jett’s grumbling, Stunt looks like he’s enjoying himself. After all, this is the type of game he loves.
Reva’s paying attention, though likely only to note the inefficiencies of Crash and KaiNE.
Both of the protoss players complete the buildings necessary for their attacks simultaneously, but it’s the Team Crash player who’s out of the map first.
A proxy pylon near the KaiNE player’s base will allow for quick front line reinforcements. Things would be going perfect for Crash, if not for one small problem…
The attack was spotted. Rather than answer with his own attack, the KaiNE player is holding his units back at home… And he’s hiding half of them in a small corner of his base.
I realize what’s happening just as the Crash player makes his move. Without the proper intel on his opponent, he feints a motion at his opponent’s ramp in the hopes of learning what he’s up against.
But the KaiNE player doesn’t even budge. No forcefield. No panicked chronoboost. Nothing. No defense at all.
After a moment’s hesitation, the Crash player charges up the ramp fully, confident that he’s caught his opponent in a moment of weakness.
For a moment, it looks like it was the right move. He heads forward to disable the KaiNE infrastructure…
And has his exit cut off. The KaiNE player reveals his hidden units and surges into Crash force.
Even though the battle begins with the two at an even unit count, the forcefield preventing the Crash player’s retreat also keeps his reinforcements from joining with his main army.
Despite some excellent unit control, the dwindling Crash army is devoured by the ambush. JangL taps out a gg, and the first game goes to KaiNE.
An exceptional trap set by Shing! The key was the position of his three extra gateways!
He allowed the Crash player to catch sight of a single gateway, which led him to believe that there was hidden tech at the back of his base! Excellent tactical thinking.
Indeed! It would have be too risky to find out with certainty what was coming next. He had to act. He should have cleared the path to his opponent’s base before showing his units!
Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.
That could not have been more stupid. This is what happens in a matchup where scouting past the three minute mark is impossible.
KaiNE is fortunate that JangL hesitated. Had he disabled the forward gateway in time, Crash would have been victorious.
I aim my attention back at the Crash bench to see who they’re sending out next. Accel turns back and whispers to one of his teammates, and he starts heading for the booth.
Finally, some ZvP. Better hope that Shing’s all-ins aren’t as pitiful as yours, Stunt.
Two minutes later, the Crash zerg stands cross map with the KaiNE player.
The match opens off slowly, but a sudden greedy opening from the KaiNE protoss elicits a call for attention from the commentators.
Yaaah! How bold! The map does not lend itself to a nexus first, yet he has planted one down without pause!
And it seems that it will be going unpunished! With one victory already, it seems that KaiNE decided now was an appropriate time to take a risk!
This spells bad news for Crash. With the protoss economy established so quickly, zerg will struggle to survive his powerful mid-game attack!
The commentator’s warning shows itself to be a well-informed one. The Crash player realizes his disadvantaged position too late. From inside the booth, he looks visibly shaken.
Shing marches across the map at the eight minute mark with an absurd number of blink stalkers, not bothering to clear the watch towers on the way over. His unscouted forward pylon allows him to power forward unchecked.
The Crash zerg’s clumsy defense is painful to watch. The game was decided by the two minute mark, even if it took the protoss another seven to play it out.
That was embarassing.
Not my prefered all-in style, but I’ll admit it has its merits.
A sudden realization that three out of four of us are on camera puts our conversation on pause. The VSL loves to show foreigners and girls in the breaks between games on stream for whatever reason.
Reva shields her face and glances away while I wave and watch myself on screen with an undeniably awkward expression.
The cameraman makes the mistake of panning past us to focus solely on Jett.
Not a second later, the scene switches back to the casters.
What kind of idiot doesn’t drone scout? He went pool first! It was an easy slow ling rally for the win.
The map lends itself to a typical zerg playstyle. He mistakenly believed that if he could defend an early rush from protoss, he would have an advantage going into the mid-game.
Mmm. I can already taste the extra large bibimbap. I’ll take cash, Jett.
Quiet. 0-2 isn’t impossible to come back from.
But Jett’s confidence falters a minute into the third game. The KaiNE protoss immediately sends a probe cross-map, intent on deciding the game with an early rush.
SCOUT AROUND YOUR NATURAL, MORON. IT TAKES TWO SECONDS.
And, as if he somehow heard the order through his booth’s soundproof foam, the Crash zerg catches sight of the proxy gateways just as they finish constructing.
A moment later and the game would have been decided! How will the zerg react?!
He responds by throwing down static defense in his main. A good option, since a pair of stationary spinecrawlers are too strong to contest with just a few zealots.
The hatchery finishes despite the protoss’ efforts to force a cancel. It looks like Crash is going to stabilize here. Or would, if not for...
No! What are you doing!?! STOP!
Jett takes two fistfuls of her own hair when the zerg uproots a spinecrawler and begins moving it down the ramp.
The protoss reaction is instant. The KaiNE player rushes in to take a fight with the remaining static defense.
Even with a handful of zerglings and a queen aiding, the spinecrawler falls with only a single casualty for the protoss.
An unmistakable blunder! He aimed to defend his natural expansion with the second spinecrawler, but failed to wait until he had enough zerglings!
Such impatience is going to cost Crash the game and perhaps the series!
With the free pick-off, it’s not long until the KaiNE player snowballs his lead into a victory.
One of his teammates charges into the booth and claps his back a dozen times, both of them smiling through some banter.
It’s a stark difference from the Crash bench. All save Accel look ready to accept defeat.
With a calm look back at his coach and a nod, he rises to replace his fallen teammate.
It seems that Crash will send Accel as their final player. Will he be able to prevent the all-kill from Shing?
We must take into account KaiNE’s morale. The momentum in the series certainly favors a fourth and final victory.
ACCEL. DO NOT LOSE.
A few of the people seated in front of Jett wince at the volume of her jeer, turn around, stare, and then realize that they were about to shush a VSL Champion.
By the time she's finished signing a phone case from one of them, Accel is in the booth and ready to go.
Think he can bring it back, Reva?
No single player on KaiNE can match Accel.
I find myself in agreement with that. But Reva’s specific wording and lack of a conclusion leaves me wondering.
What could be the final match of the day begins now! Accel against Shing, who will emerge victorious?
Accel looks at home in the booth. He shows the four of us a smile and a thumbs up just before the game loads in.
Despite the dire position his team is in, Accel wastes no time fighting back for control of the series.
He deflects the KaiNE player’s pressure with a well positioned marine force at the top of his ramp, killing off a zealot and scaring away a stalker.
A vital maneuver! The protoss now lacks the information on whether or not Accel is expanding!
How will he cover his options? Accel’s cloaked banshee is nearly complete!
The KaiNE player hesitates, and second later, throws down an expansion. Jett heaves a sigh of relief, confident that the game is decided.
Classic protoss move. Don’t Think, Guess.
It’s true that if Accel had been expanding, the KaiNE player would have earned a slight edge.
Instead he’s is forced to watch helplessly as Accel’s banshee flies straight into his base and blasts his worker line to pieces.
With a highly delayed and evidently begrudged gg from KaiNE, Accel puts Crash on the board.
Hah. Salty that he didn’t get his all-kill.
Why did the protoss leave so early? He could have at least gone for a base trade or something.
Are you kidding? Terrans have had base trades figured out for almost a year now! God, I wish my gateways could fly.
I guess. But there's no reason to throw in the towel so early. Even if he was going to lose, he could at least try to wear Accel out for the games to come. Accel could easily bring this back.
But even with his team’s first loss, the KaiNE coach looks confident. He gestures for one of his youngest players, speaks to him for almost an entire minute, and then sends him to the booth.
Ahhhh! The KaiNE coach sends an amateur terran to face Accel? He must have confidence in either his young talent or remaining two players!
We must assume he wants to give the young terran some experience. Certainly, there is no other reason to send him against as strong a contender as Accel!
Reva watches the KaiNE coach impassively, never allowing her attention to leave him until the fifth game loads in.
Yaaaaaah! KaiNE opens with command center first!
It seems that the KaiNE team has a strong preference to set the pace of the game and force their opponents to react! How will Accel respond?
Accel is going to scout it and throw down his own CC. What else? He’ll outmacro this kid anyway.
Reva answers Jett with a nod, though not in a way that makes her seem particularly pleased.
As predicted, Accel’s thorough scout discovers the KaiNE command center early enough to stay in an economy focused game.
Even with the amateur terran’s slight advantage, Accel claws his way back onto even footing and then claims a lead when he catches a drop on route to his base.
The Crash fans roar a cheer when Accel charges his opponent’s tank line in a way reminiscent of old Brood War mech battles. Old habits die hard.
Even with the game all but decided, the KaiNE terran remains until Accel moves forward to destroy his base. Just before offering his gg, the KaiNE amateur scans to reveal all of the Accel’s structures.
As I thought.
I wince as Jett belts out a ear-shattering cheer and then turn to Reva.
What do you mean?
KaiNE will send their terran ace.
Not such a hard guess, really.
But even the previously confident Jett watches KaiNE's bench now. Sure enough, their team’s ace pulls himself to his feet, peels off his team jacket, and tosses it to a squealing fangirl.
... Did she just sniff it? I’m going to pretend I didn’t see that.
The Crash coach paces back and forth with his hands behind his back. His bench looks far more invested in the series than they did two games ago.
What a treat! The highest level of terran versus terran is about to unfold before us!
I am excited to see how Accel measures up! His TvT has always been his strongest matchup.
Jett and Reva watch restlessly as the game loads up. Even Stunt has stopped cheering against Crash.
KaiNE will go command center first. If Accel does not two rax, he will be at a disadvantage.
Are you from the future or something? What’s with these super specific predictions?
Shut up. Watch.
Accel opens with standard play and repeats the scout of his opponent’s CC first at a timing near identical to last game.
Feigned bunker aggression provokes brief panic in the KaiNE ace, forcing him to pull a handful of SCVs to contest what could be a direct counter to his build.
A good move. But it will not be enough.
When the fake rush ends, the KaiNE player throws his head back, heaves a sigh of relief, and smiles. He begins teching aggressively, a dangerous option without scouting Accel.
Can you please explain what is going on? Why do you know what’s happening before it happens?
The KaiNE ace used the amateur to bait out Accel’s response to CC first. This isn’t something that would be possible if they weren’t ahead by so many games.
They sent their best player to face Accel with full knowledge of his reaction. But Accel can adapt on the fly, right?
Easier said than done.
Sure enough, Accel’s answer is the exact same as it was to the amateur before. Improvising is a rare skill for StarCraft players, even for someone as skilled and well-rounded as Accel.
The KaiNE player will build two starports behind his natural to avoid Accel’s typical scan patterns. He will then clear out Accel’s map vision with hellions and then camp Accel’s production with banshees and vikings.
This isn’t over. Accel will scout the gas timings and might realize that something is off.
But the strategy proves to be too specific for Accel to cover without scouting directly. The missile turret in his worker line won’t protect his production structures.
Accel's scan misses the mark by mere pixels. There's no chance he'll be prepared in time.
With the center of the map clear, the KaiNE terran flies straight for Accel’s base.
Unbelievable! We rarely see such a unit composition, but it is the perfect answer in this scenario!
The vikings keeps Accel’s inferior air force at bay, while the banshees pound Accel’s structures and tanks without answer.
An attempt to establish a missile turret defense costs Accel a ton of workers. When he eventually stabilizes, his army is less than half the size of the KaiNE ace’s.
The game is over. Yet Accel remains until the bitter end, trading as cost-efficiently with his inferior force as he can.
It’s only once the KaiNE ace dances his units back and forth that Accel finally taps out.
A cheer from the ace’s fans announces the conclusion of the series. 4-2, KaiNE.

Your APM is low.
I wince and respond with a flurry of unneccesary keystrokes. I’ve never cracked 300 APM, even when I’m focused on doing so.
A minute or two passes without comment, though it’s hard to tell whether or not that means she thinks I’m playing well.
Your engineering bays are late.
Are they? They are. Dammit.
I whip my mouse hard, box a pair of SCVs, and slam down the two delayed structures.
I check his army composition with a scan and decide I'm ready to challenge him.
Delayed upgrades or no, I managed to keep a close enough eye on my opponent’s tech that I have a massive swell of vikings by the time his colossus come into play.
His army gets caught in an awkward position when he tries to establish his third base, allowing me to power forward into his base. It’s a win I’d normally celebrate with a self-assured smile.
I had thought that Reva’s low-key attitude might have made her a little bit lenient with my mistakes. But she’s not all that different from Jett, minus how she delivers her criticism.
My next match is on the largest map in the current ladder pool. I’ll have a pretty easy time defending my expansions with the way that the map’s choke points are constructed.
Rather than poke and prod with marines or go for early aggression, I throw down a quick third base in a far-flung corner of the map shortly I begin my natural expansion.
Pulling off this kind of tactic is incredibly rewarding. If it goes unscouted, I'm practically guaranteed to win.
Why are you doing that? Practice something useful.
I shift my gaze aside to find Reva uncomfortably close to both me and the monitor.
What if I decide to hide an expansion against Bolt?
Are you going to risk the team on a coinflip? Cancel it and aim for a long game.
Reva offer the advice too firm to be called a suggestion, and I find myself moving the mouse to do as instructed. This gaffe is going to set me back a fair bit.
I gear up for a drawn out match by focusing on my upgrades and base defense. It’s not long before my protoss opponent and I have split the map in half and are jockeying for position.
Build more defenses. You can afford a dozen planetary fortresses.
Is that really necessary?
Mach, your opponent is protoss. Protoss players will stop at nothing to cheat an honest terran out of an earned win.
Funny. I typically image balance whiners as loud and obnoxious in real life. I wonder if she quit playing random out of guilt.
Still, I oblige her and cram as many static defense structures as I can into a vital choke point.
There is an observer over your army.
I squint to find that she’s right. Damn, how did I not catch that earlier? With a scan, I pick off the protoss scout and reposition my units.
It takes a few minutes to adjust my army composition to one that better suits the extreme late game, but I’m soon ready to clash with my opponent.
At this point, StarCraft becomes less about strategy and more about patience. It's important to know when to stalk and when to pounce.
I sense an opening at last and rush into my opponent’s weak flank. Out of the corner of my eye I can see Reva tensing up, invested as much as I am in the outcome of the battle.
But try as I might, my snipes don’t connect with the high templar scattered amongst the protoss army.
He drowns my units in psi storm and steamrolls down the center of the map, destroying my constructed defenses along the way.
I struggle pointlessly to mount a counteroffensive, but the damage is done. I’m forced to tap out a gg and quit the match with a huff.
I soon find that her confidence is well placed. Even with Reva's economy-focused build order, Stunt's stalker harass makes my life difficult.
He dances the single unit back and forth at the entrance to my natural, all of his focus devoted to its control.
It's a painfully effective frustration that succeeds in slowing down my attempts at establishing economy and tech.
My multitasking and micro are brought to their limits, and we haven’t even hit the five minute mark. This is insane.
And very, very good practice.
I don’t have the chance to spare a glance over my shoulder at Accel or Jett, but I’d make a pretty sure bet that they’re just as intent on the game as Stunt, Reva, and I are.
The match drags on up until the Stunt and Reva archon rolls over my paltry force with a well-timed and perfectly controlled two-base push. It wasn't even close.

Snag a quick win
Workers, minerals, vespene gas, and a command center. I start out every match with only these resources at my disposal. It's my job to turn them into something that can defeat my opponent.
Generally, that means I need to build structures capable of training units for my army. My build order determines how my end of the matchup plays out.
This game, I've opted for a quick hellion attack. Not only will it offer me a chance to deal some damage to my opponent, but it will also allow me to scout.
But it seems I don't have much to worry about. My opponent went for a greedy build order—focusing entirely on his economy instead of his army.
Unfortunately for him, the match isn't going to last long enough for that risk to pay off. My hellions make short work of his single queen and handful of zerglings.
With his frontline out of the way, I'm free to rush into his mineral line and roast his workers, denying him the resources he needs to muster an army.
Facing down a marine reinforcement, it's not long before my zerg opponent types out the two letters: GG. Easy.
I haven't gone up against a player as strong as Accel in a while. There probably wasn't a single person at the VSL qualifier at his level.
That only makes a potential victory all the more tantalizing. It's a chance to prove to myself that I've got what it takes.
Even if I've decided on playing standard, I've still got a decision to make in how to execute my mid-game strategy.
This map is well-suited for a hellion attack. I'll have plenty of room to poke around his expansion since it lacks a choke point.
An attack by air might also be a strong option. The distance between our bases is relatively long by land, but it'll take a banshee less than five seconds to travel from mine to his.
I'm confident with both styles. It's just a matter of how I want to execute the attack.
I produce my hellions two at a time and send my first four across the map.
It takes a few extra seconds to clear out the space between our bases. Confident that I have enough breathing room, I prepare for my first attack.
My hellions make a beeline for his natural expansion's worker line. With some decent micro on my part, I manage to secure a few worker kills before ordering a retreat.
A lesser player might have sacrificed four hellions for more economic damage. But I've practiced this style enough to know that I'll lose map control without them.
I cut all extraneous unit production to get out a banshee as soon as possible. The earlier I'm able to hit, the less chance that Accel will have the right defenses.
With my banshee en route, I clear out the path to his base with a handful of marines. Denying information to my opponent is important, even if I don't plan to attack from that blind spot.
It seems to have been the right choice, as his marines are out of position when my banshee arrives at his base. I manage to secure a few worker kills before ordering a retreat.
Since I didn't lose my banshee, Accel has to spend minerals on air defense. Knowing that, I prepare to transition to a full-on ground army.
This game is going insanely well. Though Accel took his expansion before I did, the damage he took puts us on even footing.
I follow up with an army of marines, marauders, and dropships: the bread and butter of most terran players.
Since I cleared the space between our bases, he's in the dark about the timing of this next attack. There's a solid chance that I could do enough damage here to end the game!
But just as I arrive at the outskirts of Accel's expansion, one of his dropships uploads a handful of marines in my base. Tch, that's going to slow down my ability to reinforce.
Woah! Shit! With my focus on the drop in my main, Accel rushed into the army I left outside of his base while I wasn't paying attention. He's got a concave formation on me!
And just like that, my advantage evaporates. Though I manage to stay in the game for a bit longer, Accel wisely guards his lead by immediately taking a third base.
Soon enough, his economic advantage is reflected in the size of his army. After my blunder, Accel's play was airtight. There really wasn't anything for me to do.
With a groan, I offer a gg and concede the match.
Game after game is a beatdown. I can't crack her defenses when I attack, and I'm barely holding on when she goes on offense.
She's just as unforgiving in pointing out my mistakes as she is in-game.
Your wall at the ramp to your natural is trash. How the hell do you get away with this? You're asking to get busted.
It's not something I really think about that much. I just throw it up, you know?
Fix it or be punished.
That probably isn’t an idle threat. Jett is the type of player capable of ending the game instantly if she can capitalize on the right kind of mistake.
Her style has been characterized as both passive and reactive. She takes her time and watches her opponents, patient for the right moment to strike. She only takes a risk if it’s calculated in her favor.
Given her former success, the style has suited her well. Though I can’t help but wonder why she hasn’t lately been performing at her previous level. Maybe she’s lost her killer instinct?
Guess not. A reminder of the skill difference between us rushes up the ramp to my natural expansion and crushes my wall, as promised.
In the aftermath of the destruction, she swarms my base and seizes an easy win. Jett revels in her victory with a predatory smile.
Wrecked.
If the idea behind practicing against a good player is to improve, I should probably play standard.
Still the temptation to all-in is always there. How sick would it be to grab a quick win on a KPGA player?
It’s probably best that I follow Jett's advice. I opt for a standard macromanagement game, this guy’s build permitting.
I take my natural expansion and begin teching up. The match progresses quietly with only a few brief skirmishes with his stalkers and my marines.
My scan show that he's not doing anything out of the ordinary. One of us has to make a move sooner or later.
I start constructing my starport and researching my bio upgrades. I’m surprised to find that they finish without any pressure coming from the protoss army.
This could be a good time to go for some drop play and try to snipe some of his critical tech buildings.
If I were to play an aggressive drop style, I need to be confident in my control and in the fact that I can outplay him.
On the other hand, this game has been exceptionally quiet. If I could get up another expansion, I’ll have a serious economic advantage going into the late game.
Screw it, I'm not in the mood for macro.
I place two early barracks mid-map, just outside his scouting path. With luck, he won’t see my strategy until it’s coming at him.
My heart pounds as I watch my marine count grow. He still hasn’t scouted my all-in.
This is a huge advantage. I've got this.
I bring my marines to his base and charge up the ramp leading to his high ground. I leave an SCV on the low ground to construct a bunker just in case I have to fall back.
He retreats with his lone zealot and begins to chronoboost something out of his gateway, likely a stalker. He still hasn’t pulled his probes, so I start heading towards the mineral line.
Shit! He preemptively pulled a handful of probes and hid them out of my vision! With my exit cut off, I won't be able to escape!
Things look even worse when he gets his first stalker out. He might actually hold this!
I do everything I can salvage the situation, but it's too late. The single marine I manage to get into my bunker is useless at this point. From the low ground, I can’t do any damage to his units.
My attack was completely routed. Even though he didn't scout out the rush, he defended without breaking a sweat.
I cut marines long enough to save up for a quick third base. It finishes before my first dropship is even out.
Just as my expansion finishes constructing, a red blip shows up on my minimap. Is it a void ray? I have missile turrets to defend, so I should be fine.
Wait no...it's floating on the outskirts of my base. A warp prism? He’ll be be able to warp his units into my base! My army is completely out of position!
He starts warping in just outside of my static defenses. Zealots rush into my base and tear my mineral line to pieces before I can move units back to defend. This is bad.
Oh god, he's at my natural too? He’s got such a big army! I can’t keep my defenses up with my economy crippled.
I spread myself way too thin. Ugh. If only I had done a better job scouting.
With my production structures camped, my units die almost the second they finish training. That's checkmate.
Dropship play is a defining characteristic of a top terran player. If I win with this, it's a good indication that I can stand toe-to-toe with the best players in Korea.
It's time to put my practice to work. I gather enough units for an attack at my starport as the first dropship finishes.
It's imperative he doesn't see me move out, so I make sure the watch towers are clear and avoid places where protoss players commonly leave their observers.
When my dropships are in the clear, I fly straight into his base. He's unprepared for the attack, and I unload all my units rush to snipe some important tech buildings.
With the damage to his infrastructure done, my units retreat for the safety of my dropship. That set him back a ton.
The game is going incredibly well, so I decide to pull back on my aggression and build up an army for a final push.
He's been too busy defending to get a decent standing army, and when I roll in with my amassed units...
... he kites back, bobbing and weaving away from my forces while delivering potshots.
I give chase, the taste of victory tantalizingly close. I manage to corner his army, leaving him with nowhere to run.
But just as I move in to deliver to final blow…
He flanks me with a half dozen templar, showering my army in high-damage storms! I pull back frantically, but my army is left in tatters!
I try my hardest to gather enough units to mount a second offensive, but he continues to crush my attacks with only a handful of well-upgraded and well-microed zealots, stalkers and archons.
How the hell did this happen? My lead is gone!
Frustrated, I box all of my workers and charge towards his base for a final attack. With my SCVs on the frontlines, I should have enough power to take a direct engagement.
I roll through his fourth base uncontested! Yes! He’s giving up ground because he knows he can’t face me!
Emboldened, I drive up ramp leading to his natural to end the game…
... And find myself face to face with an ambush. My frontline evaporates before I can issue the command to retreat, and he crushes what remains of my army a few moments later.
I can’t believe it. I lost.
I stare blankly at the screen for almost ten seconds before I finally type gg and quit out of the match.
Cannons, two-gate, four-gate, blink, proxy robo, proxy stargate. There are a dozen different ways that Stunt could end this game early.
As a precaution, I scout around the interior of my base to ensure that I'm not being cannon rushed.
And, as I discover, I am. Just outside my vision range and dangerously close to my worker line, a cannon finishes building.
Some losses in a defense are inevitable, but if I handle this well it should put me ahead of Stunt.
It's gutsy of him to risk a best of one on a strategy like this. Practically all I have to do is scout it to score a victory.
By microing my injured SCVs away from cannon shots, I'm able to end the rush at a low cost. In truth, that seemed like an exceptionally weak attack. Was Accel hyping this kid up for nothing?
I end up only losing three of my workers by the time his single cannon is dead. Now, where's that probe...
There it is. With his probe down, there's no way he'll be able to drop down anymore cannons.
Still, he's probably planning his next move. I have to decide what comes next.
If he's transitioning into something standard, this would be the perfect time to counter-attack.
His tech has to be lacking, so there's no way he'll have strong enough units to defend a marine attack.
And while it seems incredibly unlikely, there's always a chance that he might have another attack ready.
If I want to err on the side of caution, I could stay in my base and simply tech up. But that might give him enough time to get back into the game.
I should make this call based on what I know about his playstyle.
I don't want to give Stunt enough time to get back on his feet. Without applying some kind of pressure, he could easily take a blind risk and put us on even footing.
His cross-map position is guaranteed due to the map's version--
Woah, shit! Zealots?! How?!
--- And again! I took my eyes off of my main army long enough that it ran into cannons positioned at the top of Stunt's choke point!
I try desperately to pull my units back in time to defend, but the damage is done.
With my economy completely eviscerated and his base well-fortified, I have no way to stay in the game.
Even though I'm giving up a chance to win the game immediately, the safe thing to do is tech up to dropships.
... But it looks like I won't need to. My precautionary scout uncovers an ambush waiting in a dark corner of my base.
With more than enough units and space to micro my marines, I dispatch his zealots with barely any losses.
A cannon rush feint into a proxy gate? Absolutely ridiculous.
With his rush routed, Stunt quits out of the game without a gg.
I won. With surprising ease, too.
Alright. Time to show Reva and everyone else that's watching what I'm made of.
I'm watching my scout cross the map when a thought occurs to me. If this guy supposedly hates rushes, I should be able to score a pretty easy win against him with one.
There's a specific proxy build that works really well on this map, especially against the type of player that Accel described Reva as. I might risk angering the person I'm trying to recruit, though.
Still, the game is being broadcast online. If I win, there's a chance that I could earn enough cred to find another player anyway.
Do I really want to go against Accel's advice? It's only one game, after all.
Why should I have to play out some hour long snore-fest just because Reva doesn't like being cheesed? It's a part of the game, whether he likes it or not.
I divert my scouting SCV's path to the bottom corner of my opponent's natural expansion. With luck, he won't see this until it's too late.
Proxy marauder is an incredibly strong build against anyone who expands early, but I could even do damage on the off-chance that he doesn't wall off entirely.
With my early gas and mineral production all devoted to this attack, I find myself in a promising position when my first marauder surges from the barracks.
Hah, command center first. He built an expansion before producing even a single unit. Punished.
I throw down a bunker at the bottom of my opponent's ramp,
 and he immediately follows suit. But he has absolutely no chance to defend without an army to his name.
I waltz my marauder up the ramp just in time to watch his first marine scramble from a barracks and rush towards his bunker. But before he can get there, my marauder picks him off.
... And just like that, the game ends. Reva quit out of the match without a single word.
Ergh. It's not like I hate playing standard or anything, I just don't like that I'm playing straight into this guy's strong point. Whatever.
As expected, the game begins with a long calm. Reva shows absolutely no sign of early aggression, instead focusing entirely on building a strong economy.
I use the breathing room to invest heavily into structures for tank production.
My scout reveals that Reva's doing the same thing. Just as Accel said, looks like it's going to be a long, drawn out tank vs. tank positioning war.
Reva and I split the map in half, one side littered with his bases, defensive structures and tanks, and one side with mine.
I'm not particularly comfortable with this style of play. I prefer an agile army accompanied by dropships, but it's next to impossible to break a meching terran if they have a strong economy.
Well, I need to start thinking about my next move. Even though my center map position--
Woah! Shit, I'm under attack!
Reva's inching his tank line towards the center of the map. He managed to find a weak position in my formation-- one of my tanks was a bit too far away from the rest, and it got picked off.
A nuke?! In a serious game?!
Not here...
Not here either! Where's the nuke?! Shit, I need to catch it before I lose my army!
Boom! There's the ghost.
Phew. I managed to catch it before the nuke went off. Alright, with that threat out of the way, I can get back to addressing the tank line
Oh.
Spawning in at the 7 o’clock position for Team Crash is the blue protoss player, JangL!
His opponent from Team KaiNE at the 2 o’clock base is Shing!
Protoss vs. Protoss, close positions. This match won’t last long.
Mirror matchups are so stupid. PvP most of all.
You don’t know the intricacies. It can sometimes be really intense!
Literally every strategy is a coinflip. PvP should be considered gambling and made illegal.
PvP usually ends with both players on one base. The decision to expand is often too great of a risk, especially with the players as close as they are.
Moreso than in any other matchup, mind games are essential to securing an advantage.
Reach too far with aggression against a balanced strategy, you lose. Go middle of the road against a tech build, you lose. Tech up against an attack, you lose.
Yaaaaah! JangL and Shing both have opted for a four warpgate strategy!
Prepare to watch these two clash! It will all come down to their control!
... Or, that. That can happen too.
Even with Jett’s grumbling, Stunt looks like he’s enjoying himself. After all, this is the type of game he loves.
Reva’s paying attention, though likely only to note the inefficiencies of Crash and KaiNE.
Both of the protoss players complete the buildings necessary for their attacks simultaneously, but it’s the Team Crash player who’s out of the map first.
A proxy pylon near the KaiNE player’s base will allow for quick front line reinforcements. Things would be going perfect for Crash, if not for one small problem…
The attack was spotted. Rather than answer with his own attack, the KaiNE player is holding his units back at home… And he’s hiding half of them in a small corner of his base.
I realize what’s happening just as the Crash player makes his move. Without the proper intel on his opponent, he feints a motion at his opponent’s ramp in the hopes of learning what he’s up against.
But the KaiNE player doesn’t even budge. No forcefield. No panicked chronoboost. Nothing. No defense at all.
After a moment’s hesitation, the Crash player charges up the ramp fully, confident that he’s caught his opponent in a moment of weakness.
For a moment, it looks like it was the right move. He heads forward to disable the KaiNE infrastructure…
And has his exit cut off. The KaiNE player reveals his hidden units and surges into Crash force.
Even though the battle begins with the two at an even unit count, the forcefield preventing the Crash player’s retreat also keeps his reinforcements from joining with his main army.
Despite some excellent unit control, the dwindling Crash army is devoured by the ambush. JangL taps out a gg, and the first game goes to KaiNE.
An exceptional trap set by Shing! The key was the position of his three extra gateways!
He allowed the Crash player to catch sight of a single gateway, which led him to believe that there was hidden tech at the back of his base! Excellent tactical thinking.
Indeed! It would have be too risky to find out with certainty what was coming next. He had to act. He should have cleared the path to his opponent’s base before showing his units!
Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.
That could not have been more stupid. This is what happens in a matchup where scouting past the three minute mark is impossible.
KaiNE is fortunate that JangL hesitated. Had he disabled the forward gateway in time, Crash would have been victorious.
I aim my attention back at the Crash bench to see who they’re sending out next. Accel turns back and whispers to one of his teammates, and he starts heading for the booth.
Finally, some ZvP. Better hope that Shing’s all-ins aren’t as pitiful as yours, Stunt.
Two minutes later, the Crash zerg stands cross map with the KaiNE player.
The match opens off slowly, but a sudden greedy opening from the KaiNE protoss elicits a call for attention from the commentators.
Yaaah! How bold! The map does not lend itself to a nexus first, yet he has planted one down without pause!
And it seems that it will be going unpunished! With one victory already, it seems that KaiNE decided now was an appropriate time to take a risk!
This spells bad news for Crash. With the protoss economy established so quickly, zerg will struggle to survive his powerful mid-game attack!
The commentator’s warning shows itself to be a well-informed one. The Crash player realizes his disadvantaged position too late. From inside the booth, he looks visibly shaken.
Shing marches across the map at the eight minute mark with an absurd number of blink stalkers, not bothering to clear the watch towers on the way over. His unscouted forward pylon allows him to power forward unchecked.
The Crash zerg’s clumsy defense is painful to watch. The game was decided by the two minute mark, even if it took the protoss another seven to play it out.
That was embarassing.
Not my prefered all-in style, but I’ll admit it has its merits.
A sudden realization that three out of four of us are on camera puts our conversation on pause. The VSL loves to show foreigners and girls in the breaks between games on stream for whatever reason.
Reva shields her face and glances away while I wave and watch myself on screen with an undeniably awkward expression.
The cameraman makes the mistake of panning past us to focus solely on Jett.
Not a second later, the scene switches back to the casters.
What kind of idiot doesn’t drone scout? He went pool first! It was an easy slow ling rally for the win.
The map lends itself to a typical zerg playstyle. He mistakenly believed that if he could defend an early rush from protoss, he would have an advantage going into the mid-game.
Mmm. I can already taste the extra large bibimbap. I’ll take cash, Jett.
Quiet. 0-2 isn’t impossible to come back from.
But Jett’s confidence falters a minute into the third game. The KaiNE protoss immediately sends a probe cross-map, intent on deciding the game with an early rush.
SCOUT AROUND YOUR NATURAL, MORON. IT TAKES TWO SECONDS.
And, as if he somehow heard the order through his booth’s soundproof foam, the Crash zerg catches sight of the proxy gateways just as they finish constructing.
A moment later and the game would have been decided! How will the zerg react?!
He responds by throwing down static defense in his main. A good option, since a pair of stationary spinecrawlers are too strong to contest with just a few zealots.
The hatchery finishes despite the protoss’ efforts to force a cancel. It looks like Crash is going to stabilize here. Or would, if not for...
No! What are you doing!?! STOP!
Jett takes two fistfuls of her own hair when the zerg uproots a spinecrawler and begins moving it down the ramp.
The protoss reaction is instant. The KaiNE player rushes in to take a fight with the remaining static defense.
Even with a handful of zerglings and a queen aiding, the spinecrawler falls with only a single casualty for the protoss.
An unmistakable blunder! He aimed to defend his natural expansion with the second spinecrawler, but failed to wait until he had enough zerglings!
Such impatience is going to cost Crash the game and perhaps the series!
With the free pick-off, it’s not long until the KaiNE player snowballs his lead into a victory.
One of his teammates charges into the booth and claps his back a dozen times, both of them smiling through some banter.
It’s a stark difference from the Crash bench. All save Accel look ready to accept defeat.
With a calm look back at his coach and a nod, he rises to replace his fallen teammate.
It seems that Crash will send Accel as their final player. Will he be able to prevent the all-kill from Shing?
We must take into account KaiNE’s morale. The momentum in the series certainly favors a fourth and final victory.
ACCEL. DO NOT LOSE.
A few of the people seated in front of Jett wince at the volume of her jeer, turn around, stare, and then realize that they were about to shush a VSL Champion.
By the time she's finished signing a phone case from one of them, Accel is in the booth and ready to go.
Think he can bring it back, Reva?
No single player on KaiNE can match Accel.
I find myself in agreement with that. But Reva’s specific wording and lack of a conclusion leaves me wondering.
What could be the final match of the day begins now! Accel against Shing, who will emerge victorious?
Accel looks at home in the booth. He shows the four of us a smile and a thumbs up just before the game loads in.
Despite the dire position his team is in, Accel wastes no time fighting back for control of the series.
He deflects the KaiNE player’s pressure with a well positioned marine force at the top of his ramp, killing off a zealot and scaring away a stalker.
A vital maneuver! The protoss now lacks the information on whether or not Accel is expanding!
How will he cover his options? Accel’s cloaked banshee is nearly complete!
The KaiNE player hesitates, and second later, throws down an expansion. Jett heaves a sigh of relief, confident that the game is decided.
Classic protoss move. Don’t Think, Guess.
It’s true that if Accel had been expanding, the KaiNE player would have earned a slight edge.
Instead he’s is forced to watch helplessly as Accel’s banshee flies straight into his base and blasts his worker line to pieces.
With a highly delayed and evidently begrudged gg from KaiNE, Accel puts Crash on the board.
Hah. Salty that he didn’t get his all-kill.
Why did the protoss leave so early? He could have at least gone for a base trade or something.
Are you kidding? Terrans have had base trades figured out for almost a year now! God, I wish my gateways could fly.
I guess. But there's no reason to throw in the towel so early. Even if he was going to lose, he could at least try to wear Accel out for the games to come. Accel could easily bring this back.
But even with his team’s first loss, the KaiNE coach looks confident. He gestures for one of his youngest players, speaks to him for almost an entire minute, and then sends him to the booth.
Ahhhh! The KaiNE coach sends an amateur terran to face Accel? He must have confidence in either his young talent or remaining two players!
We must assume he wants to give the young terran some experience. Certainly, there is no other reason to send him against as strong a contender as Accel!
Reva watches the KaiNE coach impassively, never allowing her attention to leave him until the fifth game loads in.
Yaaaaaah! KaiNE opens with command center first!
It seems that the KaiNE team has a strong preference to set the pace of the game and force their opponents to react! How will Accel respond?
Accel is going to scout it and throw down his own CC. What else? He’ll outmacro this kid anyway.
Reva answers Jett with a nod, though not in a way that makes her seem particularly pleased.
As predicted, Accel’s thorough scout discovers the KaiNE command center early enough to stay in an economy focused game.
Even with the amateur terran’s slight advantage, Accel claws his way back onto even footing and then claims a lead when he catches a drop on route to his base.
The Crash fans roar a cheer when Accel charges his opponent’s tank line in a way reminiscent of old Brood War mech battles. Old habits die hard.
Even with the game all but decided, the KaiNE terran remains until Accel moves forward to destroy his base. Just before offering his gg, the KaiNE amateur scans to reveal all of the Accel’s structures.
As I thought.
I wince as Jett belts out a ear-shattering cheer and then turn to Reva.
What do you mean?
KaiNE will send their terran ace.
Not such a hard guess, really.
But even the previously confident Jett watches KaiNE's bench now. Sure enough, their team’s ace pulls himself to his feet, peels off his team jacket, and tosses it to a squealing fangirl.
... Did she just sniff it? I’m going to pretend I didn’t see that.
The Crash coach paces back and forth with his hands behind his back. His bench looks far more invested in the series than they did two games ago.
What a treat! The highest level of terran versus terran is about to unfold before us!
I am excited to see how Accel measures up! His TvT has always been his strongest matchup.
Jett and Reva watch restlessly as the game loads up. Even Stunt has stopped cheering against Crash.
KaiNE will go command center first. If Accel does not two rax, he will be at a disadvantage.
Are you from the future or something? What’s with these super specific predictions?
Shut up. Watch.
Accel opens with standard play and repeats the scout of his opponent’s CC first at a timing near identical to last game.
Feigned bunker aggression provokes brief panic in the KaiNE ace, forcing him to pull a handful of SCVs to contest what could be a direct counter to his build.
A good move. But it will not be enough.
When the fake rush ends, the KaiNE player throws his head back, heaves a sigh of relief, and smiles. He begins teching aggressively, a dangerous option without scouting Accel.
Can you please explain what is going on? Why do you know what’s happening before it happens?
The KaiNE ace used the amateur to bait out Accel’s response to CC first. This isn’t something that would be possible if they weren’t ahead by so many games.
They sent their best player to face Accel with full knowledge of his reaction. But Accel can adapt on the fly, right?
Easier said than done.
Sure enough, Accel’s answer is the exact same as it was to the amateur before. Improvising is a rare skill for StarCraft players, even for someone as skilled and well-rounded as Accel.
The KaiNE player will build two starports behind his natural to avoid Accel’s typical scan patterns. He will then clear out Accel’s map vision with hellions and then camp Accel’s production with banshees and vikings.
This isn’t over. Accel will scout the gas timings and might realize that something is off.
But the strategy proves to be too specific for Accel to cover without scouting directly. The missile turret in his worker line won’t protect his production structures.
Accel's scan misses the mark by mere pixels. There's no chance he'll be prepared in time.
With the center of the map clear, the KaiNE terran flies straight for Accel’s base.
Unbelievable! We rarely see such a unit composition, but it is the perfect answer in this scenario!
The vikings keeps Accel’s inferior air force at bay, while the banshees pound Accel’s structures and tanks without answer.
An attempt to establish a missile turret defense costs Accel a ton of workers. When he eventually stabilizes, his army is less than half the size of the KaiNE ace’s.
The game is over. Yet Accel remains until the bitter end, trading as cost-efficiently with his inferior force as he can.
It’s only once the KaiNE ace dances his units back and forth that Accel finally taps out.
A cheer from the ace’s fans announces the conclusion of the series. 4-2, KaiNE.

Your APM is low.
I wince and respond with a flurry of unneccesary keystrokes. I’ve never cracked 300 APM, even when I’m focused on doing so.
A minute or two passes without comment, though it’s hard to tell whether or not that means she thinks I’m playing well.
Your engineering bays are late.
Are they? They are. Dammit.
I whip my mouse hard, box a pair of SCVs, and slam down the two delayed structures.
I check his army composition with a scan and decide I'm ready to challenge him.
Delayed upgrades or no, I managed to keep a close enough eye on my opponent’s tech that I have a massive swell of vikings by the time his colossus come into play.
His army gets caught in an awkward position when he tries to establish his third base, allowing me to power forward into his base. It’s a win I’d normally celebrate with a self-assured smile.
I had thought that Reva’s low-key attitude might have made her a little bit lenient with my mistakes. But she’s not all that different from Jett, minus how she delivers her criticism.
My next match is on the largest map in the current ladder pool. I’ll have a pretty easy time defending my expansions with the way that the map’s choke points are constructed.
Rather than poke and prod with marines or go for early aggression, I throw down a quick third base in a far-flung corner of the map shortly I begin my natural expansion.
Pulling off this kind of tactic is incredibly rewarding. If it goes unscouted, I'm practically guaranteed to win.
Why are you doing that? Practice something useful.
I shift my gaze aside to find Reva uncomfortably close to both me and the monitor.
What if I decide to hide an expansion against Bolt?
Are you going to risk the team on a coinflip? Cancel it and aim for a long game.
Reva offer the advice too firm to be called a suggestion, and I find myself moving the mouse to do as instructed. This gaffe is going to set me back a fair bit.
I gear up for a drawn out match by focusing on my upgrades and base defense. It’s not long before my protoss opponent and I have split the map in half and are jockeying for position.
Build more defenses. You can afford a dozen planetary fortresses.
Is that really necessary?
Mach, your opponent is protoss. Protoss players will stop at nothing to cheat an honest terran out of an earned win.
Funny. I typically image balance whiners as loud and obnoxious in real life. I wonder if she quit playing random out of guilt.
Still, I oblige her and cram as many static defense structures as I can into a vital choke point.
There is an observer over your army.
I squint to find that she’s right. Damn, how did I not catch that earlier? With a scan, I pick off the protoss scout and reposition my units.
It takes a few minutes to adjust my army composition to one that better suits the extreme late game, but I’m soon ready to clash with my opponent.
At this point, StarCraft becomes less about strategy and more about patience. It's important to know when to stalk and when to pounce.
I sense an opening at last and rush into my opponent’s weak flank. Out of the corner of my eye I can see Reva tensing up, invested as much as I am in the outcome of the battle.
But try as I might, my snipes don’t connect with the high templar scattered amongst the protoss army.
He drowns my units in psi storm and steamrolls down the center of the map, destroying my constructed defenses along the way.
I struggle pointlessly to mount a counteroffensive, but the damage is done. I’m forced to tap out a gg and quit the match with a huff.
I soon find that her confidence is well placed. Even with Reva's economy-focused build order, Stunt's stalker harass makes my life difficult.
He dances the single unit back and forth at the entrance to my natural, all of his focus devoted to its control.
It's a painfully effective frustration that succeeds in slowing down my attempts at establishing economy and tech.
My multitasking and micro are brought to their limits, and we haven’t even hit the five minute mark. This is insane.
And very, very good practice.
I don’t have the chance to spare a glance over my shoulder at Accel or Jett, but I’d make a pretty sure bet that they’re just as intent on the game as Stunt, Reva, and I are.
The match drags on up until the Stunt and Reva archon rolls over my paltry force with a well-timed and perfectly controlled two-base push. It wasn't even close.
There’s a certain feeling that every StarCraft player gets before they lose.
Most try to ignore it at first, as if the inevitable is just another challenge to fight through.
Like their past mistakes don’t count if they just try a little bit harder.
It's a natural thing. To believe otherwise contradicts the hours we spend practicing.
Still, every player must eventually come to terms with a defeat.
That they have to queue up for another game, or maybe that they flew across the world for nothing.
I haven't met many players that can take a loss in stride.
It’s painful. It's permanent. It's proof that your best isn't always enough.
Long after my elimination, I remain at the PC with a blank look in my eye.
Clicks shoot from my finger as I leap from page to page. A tournament update mentions my defeat in passing, but no one acknowledges it.
When my frustration fades, I’m left only with guilt.
I should have practiced harder.
I consider sticking around to watch the final few games, but the knot in my stomach persuades me to avoid anymore stress.
People are nice enough to a foreigner with the heart to attempt a StarLeague qualifier.
But without a win, I’m just one more in a long line of losers.
Every game of StarCraft begins the same.
Gather resources.
Train a worker. 
Construct a building.
Rally an army.
Defend a base.
Contest the map.
Turn something small into something more.
This game is punishing. It’s stressful. It’s draining. It builds you up and tears you down.
It’s not for everyone. It might not even be for me.
How many more chances am I going to get? Was that my last?
Oh. The feeling is back.
Hah… Why am I still trying? Why can’t I quit?
My fist rattles the desk and sends a plastic bottle onto the floor. With my chin in hand, I throw myself into the match replay.
I force down a measured breath. Losing a throwaway ladder game shouldn't bother a player of my rank.
Scout denial and my poor control of the final fight gave my opponent the edge. In retrospect, my mistakes seem obvious.
I toy with the conclusion that he was hacking before realizing that I’m just making excuses. No, I should have been able to win that one.
Despite the Grandmaster badge next to my handle, I find myself too anxious to queue up for another game.
The loss at the Victory StarLeague qualifier earlier today isn't helping my mindset. I comb my tiny room with a look, restless and unmotivated.
Sitting alone in a dark room for extended periods of time is incredibly depressing, a fact I learned only when it became a significant part of my life.
Only one thing is certain. I’ve got to get out of here.
After double-checking that my apartment's door is locked, I hustle down the stairs and onto the sidewalk. Light grows with each step towards the shining skyline.
Catchy pop beats and posters of flawless models dominate street after street. Foot traffic is thick and impatient. Seoul Tower stands tall from a distant hilltop.
But even the lingering excitement of life in a faraway place can't dredge me out of my hopelessness.
Sometimes, especially on days like this, I regret pursuing eSports. It's a thought I've had more times than I'd care to admit since coming to South Korea.
Even saying that, I know that I can't keep myself from competing. It's in my nature. And truth be told, this damn game is the only thing I'm good at.
What is StarCraft? Some respond to that with an explanation on its game mechanics or its storyline.
There are other popular answers too. That it requires the dexterity of a pianist alongside the strategic thinking of a chess player.
Maybe that's what StarCraft is to most people. But to the hundreds who carve out a living on it, StarCraft isn't such a simple thing.
It's the embodiment of competition, a perfect playing field. No need for athletic genes, rabid parents, tutting tutors, or expensive summer camps.
You pick up the game on your own. You learn. You improve. You work. If you're good enough, you can become a god.
And if you fail, you stay a nobody.
I'm not building towards a long-term career. I'm friendless in a foreign country. I'm respected by no one.
And if I don’t qualify for the VSL next month, I’ll be back home at square one.
I'll be nothing.
... But hey, at least I play video games all day.
Are you completely sure you haven’t forgotten anything?
Do you have enough money for the cab when you land?
Are you sure that the apartment got your money?
Is your cell phone charged? You brought an extra charger, right?
Mom. I’m fine. Please, nothing bad is going to happen.
Remember. There won’t be anyone to do your laundry, cook your meals, or wake you up when you oversleep.
Budget well and you'll have two months. I won't hear anything about a loan for the flight home.
It takes effort to keep a frown from my face. I’m certain that my parents came to see me off only so that they could say they did.
I’ve already sunk the entirety of my savings into this. Now isn’t the time for second thoughts.
My dad gestures towards the security line and taps his watch twice.
Go on. The sooner this is over with the better.
Oh, come back in one piece, hun.
Nothing comes when I think of how to respond, so I only nod. Without another word, my parents walk away.
She has to make her own mistakes.
I tighten my fist, pace quickening. Even though I want to prove everyone who's doubted me wrong, I’m tired of losing for no one’s sake but my own.
With the sun long set, overhead signs wash the streets in color. I’ve wandered so far that a walk back to my apartment would take almost a half hour.
My renewed drive to practice my craft drives my search for a place to play. It’s not long before I see the words I’m looking for: PC bang.
The amount of foot traffic suggests it's a pretty popular internet cafe. A sign on the front window reads Golden Zonefire.
Though I've only visited them a few times, PC bangs are one of the things that interested me most about Korea when I first got into StarCraft.
Duking it out for champion status of a neighborhood cafe is old school cool. Like the type of Western where a sheriff defends his turf against upstarts and outlaws.
It's an ideal that's a little bit dated these days. Most StarCraft 2 competition takes place either online or in broadcast studios.
I'll admit, I’ve daydreamed of being born a decade earlier and playing the original eSport, Brood War, during its rise alongside the PC bang.
A better time. Or so they say online.
I trundle up the stairs and pass through the doorway, immediately struck by the size of the place. There has to be at least eighty computers.
The crowd is too large for an ordinary evening. There are more people than there are PCs, even.
I indulge my curiousity on the first person I see: A dark-haired guy observing a match of SC2 from behind someone’s shoulder.
Excuse me. Is there an event going on?
The guy turns and looks at me like I’m speaking something other than Korean. After a brief silence, he responds.
Are you new or something? How have you not heard of All-Out Attack?
Yeah, I am new. Just asking.
He hums and glances away for a moment. Though he doesn’t apologize, he does fill me in.
Golden Zonefire hosts a StarCraft 2 tournament called All-Out Attack once a month. It's one of the few places you'll find a decent player outside of an online cup or a StarLeague.
Used to be a Brood War tournament, actually.
I see. Thank you. Are you here cheering for someone?
He only stares in response. The guy walks away with a shake of his head, mumbling something about foreigners.
The back of his shirt sports the Korean Pro-Gamer Association logo. Maybe he's a Brood War fan or something.
None of the StarCraft teams under KPGA’s regulations compete in anything except the original game, Brood War. Understandably, they don't want to fracture a scene they've worked hard to build up.
And that’s lucky for those of us trying to keep from drowning in a game that’s already deep with talent. KPGA players train for unbelievable hours.
Well, I came here to practice, and now I’m presented with an excellent chance to do so if what that guy said is true.
A few stares follow me as I walk forward to put my name on the sign-up list. I must look like a tourist in over my head.
I’m definitely not the first foreigner to go abroad for eSports, but most come to South Korea only once they have results or fame.
After paying for an hour's worth of PC time at the front desk, I settle for a station that has a mouse and keyboard similar to my setup back home.
A few minutes later, I join my opponent’s game lobby just in time for the start of the first round.
His name isn't familiar, so I check his profile to see he’s ranked midway through master league. Not bad for a casual player.
He seems eager enough by the rate he's spamming 'gogo' in the pre-game chat. The game gets underway once I confirm that I'm ready.
As soon as the victory screen displays, anxiety floods out of my body.
StarCraft is tense. It isn't an exaggeration to say that there's never a moment to relax until a match is over.
Bristling with confidence, I get up to check my next opponent...
... and... it’s...
 Accel....
I draw my lips in a line and let my shoulders slouch. Welp, that's the end of this tournament run.
Accel is one of South Korea’s strongest terran players. He’s well known for his old school cred, balanced playstyle, and friendly banter.
He lost in the round of eight of last season’s VSL. A respectable finish, if not a high-paying one.
From what I remember, Accel was a damn good Brood War player. But he was out of his prime when the sequel hit last year, so it makes sense that he switched.
While I’m considering what sort of rush I should do to steal a win, I feel a tap on my shoulder and turn.
Huh. So you are a foreigner.
... And find none other than the man himself standing there.
This is a bit surreal, considering I've followed Accel's play for about as long as I've been into StarCraft. Luckily, his nonchalant manner disarms my surprise.
Um. I think we play next round. I'm Mach, a terran.
He misses a beat before regaining his smile, likely surprised that I understood and then answered him.
Yeah, I saw you won your game. Not bad.
Foreigners are an uncommon sight at All-Out Attack. Are you a pro-gamer? What team are you on?
I don't know if you could call me a pro-gamer at this point, and I don't have a team. Trying to find one, though.
I do my best not to look too hopeful, though Accel's blank expression is hard to read either way. He pauses to scratch his cheek before responding.
Well, good luck. Don't expect another easy match.
You too. Uh. I mean, thanks.
Oh god, kill me. At least he laughed.
My stress from before is mostly gone. If I lose, big deal. I’m expected to lose. If I win, I beat Accel!
I’m still chewing over which cheese I should perform before finally deciding just to play standard. I shouldn't squander the rare chance to practice against a top player.
He and I banter back and forth in the pre-game lobby for a bit before the game gets underway.
I didn’t exactly throw my lead, but I did get seriously outplayed.
Fantasizing about how a victory would have felt doesn't help me keep my mind off the loss. Knowing that I did my best only helps so much.
But not a moment later, Accel turns the corner with a smile and raised eyebrows.
Hey, good game. You’re actually not bad. I assumed you were here for fun or something.
Oh, um, thanks. I am here for fun though. You play really well.
I’m surprised, most foreigners don’t hit timings like that. Good vision control too. And your scouting was top notch.
You’re really not on a team? Are you at least staying at a team house? Oh, are you studying abroad?
Nothing like that. I’m staying by myself in an apartment by the VSL studios.
So you came to Korea alone and on your own dime... And you’re not just visiting?
Err... Yes?
I do my best not to seem awkward about my answer, but any reason to worry disappears when Accel smiles.
It takes some serious guts to move out here like that. I can't think of a single person who's made it out here on their own.
A few nearby competitors watch our conversation. It’s probably not often that Accel gives his attention to a random nobody he crushes early in a bracket.
I've got some time before my next game. Let me introduce you to a friend of mine.
Oh. Sure.
With a nod, Accel leads me from the PC area to the back of the cafe.
We pass a number of known players on the way there, most lounging around no differently than the cafe's other patrons.
Maybe they aren't that different. I guess even professionals like to kick back with the tangle of cords and rush of caffeine every now and then.
Games shouldn’t be all business all the time. Although, I’d bet that KPGA executives disagree.
Accel comes to a stop away from the constant tapping of keyboards. He then plops himself into a seat against a wall and invites me to join him with a wave of his hand.
As I take my seat, I look up to find someone I recognize at his side.
Jett. A zerg and former VSL champion.
She won StarCraft 2's very first Grand Final back in the beta. A year ago, she might have been the game’s most famous player.
Her flippant and inflammatory antics have made her a somewhat controversial figure. She rarely ggs and isn't afraid to talk trash on stage.
And there she is, just sitting there. It's all I can do not to stare.
A smile plays on her lips when she glances past me to Accel.
Accel, seriously. Stop promising my autograph as a reward for beating you.
Hilarious. She can understand you, by the way. Who are you up against next round?
Some zerg dishwasher on LhT Slash. Ugh, I hate ZvZ.
Jett rolls her eyes back to me. After a brief appraisal, she lifts her chin and speaks a single word.
Name?
What? Oh. I'm Mach, a terran. I'm on... Uh, well. I'm teamless.
Jett shifts her gaze back to Accel as if to ask, ‘Why did you bring this noob back here?’
But before she can actually say anything, Accel comes to my defense with an easy smile.
Hey, cool it with the judgment until you've seen her play.
Plus, you ever hear of a foreigner that came out here alone, just for StarCraft? My girl right here did. You have to admit that's brave.
If that endorsement wasn’t convincing enough, he offers one of his classic grins for good measure. The response seems to satisfy her. For now.
While I try to keep from showing anything to contradict Accel's assessment, Jett aims her attention back at me.
Didn't see your name on the list of people who made it past the VSL qualifier. How'd you place?
I lost my second to last match. The qualifier before that, I dropped out on the final game of the last series.
Two attempts without making it, huh? Hard to tell much from that. Mainly depends on the bracket you had.
How do you live out here with no team? Do you stream or something?
I used to stream, but uh. Well. I don't anymore.
Jett raises her eyebrow, waiting for me to elaborate until I look away. Without missing a beat, she moves onto the next question.
So your parents pay for everything?
No. I’m here on my summer job earnings and a little bit extra from my grandparents.
Hm. How lucky. I never got any handouts.
This isn’t going very well. Still, Accel looks as collected as ever, watching with a smile as the interrogation continues.
Did you play Brood War?
Not really. I mean, I had a copy as a kid, but I wasn’t good. Had to cheat to even finish the campaign.
Oh, then you were only a little bit worse than Jett.
Jett scowls silently at the jab. It's true that the two years she spent playing Brood War were mostly unremarkable.
Then this is your first try at professional gaming?
When I nod, she gives me a hard look.
Why are you out here?
... Eh? What do you mean?
I'm sure you're aware of your chances. It's been more than five years since a foreign pro-gamer accomplished anything noteworthy in Korea.
I know what she's getting at, but it's not like I have a particularly great or unique answer. I scratch behind my head and look away.
I mean, why else? I want to become better at StarCraft. Everyone knows that Korea is the place to do that.
And why is that?
Well. Because the best players are out here, also I've studied the language for a while now so I have a—
No! I'm asking why you want to become better.
Oh! Er...
It feels like she's forcibly extracting the truth from me. All the same, I can't leave her expression unanswered.
I do my best to avoid showing the embarassment I feel in my honest response.
... Because I want to be a champion. Or, at the least, show I can compete at that level. Everyone who plays this game wants that, don't they?
Tch. You're right about one thing. Every idiot that makes it to grandmaster and takes a map off of a good player thinks they’re pro-gamer material.
A champion, huh? Sheesh.
She clicks her tongue and sighs, but doesn't seem displeased. Well, at least any moreso than usual.
I wouldn't have much ground to stand on if I disagreed with her. Jett is one of the few who has accomplished what the rest of us dream about.
Don’t be so harsh. Her style is solid and she stood toe to toe with me for a while. With enough time, she could compete.
What do you think? Why don’t you practice with her a bit?
I could. Little harm in giving her a chance.
Uh, wait. Back up. What just happened? Did he say practice, and did she say yes?
Accel answers her with a pleased expression. Jett takes a moment to stretch out before again crossing her arms across her chest.
Stop staring and say something, Mach.
The sound of my name wakes me from my stunned silence. I jolt upright and offer a flurry of nods.
Sorry! I say yes. I definitely say yes.
Jett and Accel watch me in silence until I lower myself back into my seat.
It takes some determination to come out here alone. Let's see if it translates to wins, eh?
With a thumbs up, it’s settled. I have somehow found myself with one of the best practice partners in the world.
I really hope this isn’t just for the novelty of playing with some random foreigner.
Accel, it's about time to get back to All-Out Attack. Wouldn't want you getting DQed if we'll be matching in the semis.
Can you be certain that I didn't lose to Mach already? What if this was my way of saving face?
Funny. Have you lost to a foreigner even once?
Hey, you never know who's playing on a barcode account.
You sure you don't want to pot split? Final offer.
Collude? With you? Not a chance.
What about you, Mach? Gonna stick around?
A PC bang with the bustle of a tournament isn’t a great training environment. The bracket will probably take a few hours to work through too.
No, I’m gonna head home. Got a lot of practicing to do tonight.
Leaving already? Well, hey. It was good to meet you.
Be at Golden Zonefire tomorrow morning and we’ll find out if you’re overhyped.
Will do.
I rise and offer them each a nod in thanks before heading back towards the PC area.
The last thing I see is a vague smile from Jett as she leans over and whispers something to Accel.
I squeeze my way through the growing crowd and manage to make it through the doorway leading outside.
When I hit the street, I’m met with a cool breeze and a rush of voices, sound, and light.
This is it. A shot. One final shot to make it happen.
One last chance to live the life I want.
I quicken my pace, eager for the comfort of a dark room and bright monitor.
This is the day that everything changes.
True to her word, Jett sent me a reminder to get over to Golden Zonefire for some morning practice.
I enjoy playing online and all, but matching against someone only a few feet away is way more productive.
Talking over games in person makes it easier to get feedback and improve. And that's what I need more than anything else.
The sting from my failure at the VSL qualifier will take time to fade. I don't want to experience that pain ever again.
I catch sight of Jett in a middle row, her attention locked on a ladder game. Without disturbing her, I take a seat at her side and watch the match unfold.
Furious taps and clicks rattle her keyboard. Her focus never drops from the game, much less her monitor. She's ahead, though not by much.
It's not long until she extends her lead in the late game and, a few minutes later, heaves a sigh of relief when her opponent ragequits out.
There's no need for me to consult my Korean skills to understand his final message: zerg imba.
You actually showed. Color me surprised.
How could I not? The better question is how you have the free time to practice with some amateur.
I'm the charitable sort, obviously.
Anyway, you're here, so let's stop wasting time. You've paid for your PC, yeah?
I nod and log myself in at the station next to hers. A minute later, the two of us are grinding out practice matches.
Before we get into the next game, I catch sight of a familiar face coming into the cafe.
Huh. Isn't that the same guy from last night?
Hey Jett. Do you know who that is?
I thumb in the stranger’s direction as he passes by us, his attention occupied by a cell phone screen. Jett trails a look after him, wrinkles her nose, and shrugs.
He’s a KPGA player. Protoss. What about him? C’mon, get into the game already.
Seriously? He was at All-Out Attack yesterday. What's he doing outside of his team house two days in a row?
They’re only figuratively chained to their desks. Not all of them are shut-ins. Stop wasting time, let’s go.
I double take away from Jett to find the player in question seated a few rows in front of us.
... And he's got the StarCraft 2 client open. Why would a KPGA player spend his practice time on anything but Brood War? Hm.
Should I ask him for a game? I think I’m going to ask him for a game.
What? No. Hold on, wait. You can't just—
But before she can stop me, I rise and shuffle my way past the rows of computers. Jett shoots me a withering glare over the top of her station before ducking back down.
Even though I’ve barely interacted with the guy, I can’t help but feel a little anxious as I edge closer to his PC.
Sure, he was a bit rude when we spoke. But the chance to challenge a KPGA pro is too good to pass up, especially if I'm trying to step up my game.
He’s about to jump into a match when I clear my throat right behind him. He subtly alt-tabs and then turns to regard me through half-lidded eyes.
What?
Excuse me. Would you mind a practice game?
Uh. No. I’m just here to...
He pauses. Recognition flits across his face.
You're the chick from All-Out Attack yesterday, aren't you?
For a moment, he looks ready to dismiss me and get to laddering. But at the last second, he nods.
Alright. One game.
With a final nod, I return to my station. A moment later, he and I share a game lobby and are just about ready to begin.
He's playing on a barcode account. Typical. How have I still not managed to catch this guy’s name?
A sharp tap against my headphones announces Jett’s return and displeasure.
You're obnoxious. If you lose and embarass me by association, I'm going to pretend I don't know you.
Anything else Jett has to say is drowned out along with the sounds of Golden Zonefire when I pull the earpad back on.
I don’t have long to sulk in defeat before the KPGA player makes his way over to me with a smirk. As promised, Jett is nowhere to be seen.
That was ugly.
Tch. The worst part is that I don't even disagree with him.
Yeah. Well. Nice micro, I guess.
You guess? Well, maybe you're right. Didn't take all that much effort to defend against such a pitiful rush.
His grin darkens to one without humor. Is this guy serious?
What the hell is your problem?
You demand a game and whine when you get a little push-back? Look who's talking!
Everyone knows your type: the foreigner out to make a name for herself. You fly out here on a whim and waste six weeks 'training.' You aren’t the first and unfortunately won’t be the last.
Your plane ticket doesn't buy you the right to call yourself a pro-gamer. Save your money and your time and go back home.
I feel the heat rise in my face, half in anger and half in embarrassment. I’ve never dealt well with confrontation.
But before I can say anything else, Jett steps out from around the corner and cuts between the two of us.
Still great at making friends, huh Bolt?
He glances between the two of us, surprised. After a moment's pause, the so-called Bolt seizes back his smirk and meets Jett with a step forward.
Been awhile, hasn't it? What's a supposed StarLeague champion doing with trash like this?
Bolt looks past her and tilts his head towards me. I take a step towards him, but an open palm from Jett stops me from going any further.
Maybe I shouldn't be surprised. Jumping ship to a scene bloated with foreign money has its upsides, but it won't be long before you forget the dignity of a pro-gamer.
The dignity of a pro-gamer, huh? You make it sound so distinguished.
You've changed for the worse and you don't even realize it. How sad.
Shouldn't be much longer until the KPGA finally accepts that there's no future in Brood War. You're smart enough to know what happens then. But hey, the scene could always use more casters.
Whatever you say. For the record, what excuse did you give your coach for another day off? VIP's a little more lax than Shock T1, but I might want to borrow it someday.
At that, Bolt scowls. Jett doesn't waste the opening and strikes again.
Don't worry dongsaeng, your secret's safe with me. Run along now, I'm sure you've got coins to flip or something.
The standoff lasts a moment longer before Bolt lets out a lazy shrug, instantly killing off the intensity in his expression.
I’ve got better things to do than offer advice to a mouthy chobo. Do what you want.
He thumbs his nose at me and returns to his station without another word.
As soon as Bolt's out of sight, Jett takes my arm in a vice and practically drags me away.
What the hell was that?! He didn't even scout you! Is this how they play on the NA servers?
Even after a heated confrontation, her concern is with the match before anything else. I almost laugh.
It was stupid of me. I thought I could just grab a quick win...
Play what you practice, for god's sake. If you're going to two rax in a tournament match, you better be damn sure you've done it a hundred times on ladder.
Her pointed critique defuses the tension from moments prior, even if it doesn't exactly make me feel any better.
When she's done going through my long list of mistakes, Jett flicks a hand back towards the PCs.
Come on. Queue up a game against me.
I don’t have long to sulk in defeat before the KPGA player makes his way over to me with a smirk. As promised, Jett is nowhere to be seen.
That was greedy.
Though it’s difficult to be graceful in defeat, I try my best anyway.
Yeah, well. It's not something I've practiced a whole lot, and I didn't really produce as efficiently as I could have.
Wouldn't have mattered. Bad mechanics should be the least of your worries.
His grin darkens to one without humor. Is this guy serious?
What the hell is your problem?
You demand a game and whine when you get a little push-back? Look who's talking!
Everyone knows your type: the foreigner out to make a name for herself. You fly out here on a whim and waste six weeks 'training.' You aren’t the first and unfortunately won’t be the last.

As soon as Bolt's out of sight, Jett takes my arm in a vice and practically drags me away.
What the hell was that?! Did you close your eyes, expand, and hope for the best?
Even after a heated confrontation, her concern is with the match before anything else. I almost laugh.
I don't know. I was trying to be kinda tricky and put my third base where he wouldn't have normally scouted.
It's blatantly obvious that you're expanding if you haven't shown an army that late in the game. All he had to do was look around the map and collect a free win.
Her pointed critique defuses the tension from moments prior, even if it doesn't exactly make me feel any better.
When she's done going through my long list of mistakes, Jett flicks a hand back towards the PCs.
Come on. Queue up a game against me.
I don’t have long to sulk in defeat before the KPGA player makes his way over to me with a smirk. As promised, Jett is nowhere to be seen.
Hey. You actually know how to play. Wasn't expecting that I'd have to try.
It’s a compliment, regardless of how he said it. Though it’s difficult to be graceful in defeat, I try my best anyway.
I played my game the best I could. Kept vision on you, dropped when I could...
But it wasn’t enough. Sucks. It’s one thing to lose carelessly, but it’s another when everything goes as planned and you fail anyway.
His grin darkens to one without humor. Is this guy serious?

As soon as Bolt's out of sight, Jett takes my arm in a vice and practically drags me away.
You had the game won! What the hell was that? An SCV pull at fifteen minutes? Is this what they teach you on the NA servers?
Even after a heated confrontation, her concern is with the match before anything else. I almost laugh.
My drops crippled him. I thought it would be enough to end the game.
So build units for two minutes and THEN go roll him. Don't be so damn impatient. Your upgrades were late too.
Her pointed critique defuses the tension from moments prior, even if it doesn't exactly make me feel any better.
When she's done going through my long list of mistakes, Jett flicks a hand back towards the PCs.
Come on. Queue up a game against me.
I told Jett that I wasn’t feeling up to practice after we played a few more one-sided games. She seemed annoyed, but agreed with my suggestion to take a short break.
Back in high school, I used to spend most of my time at the library when class was over. To be honest, this is probably the most time I've willingly spent outside of my room since then.
I’m not the type to read for fun or study diligently, but it was nice to have a place to go and be on my own. I've missed those afternoons since I graduated.
But Golden Zonefire is as good a replacement hangout as I could hope for. It's clean and comfortable, and has pretty much everything that I'd need to stay 24/7.
That isn't an exaggeration. Some of the patrons here look practically glued to their chairs.
With a milk tea from one of the vending machines in hand, I return to my seat across from Jett. She isn’t wearing the same scowl from earlier, but I can tell she’d rather be practicing.
What are you drinking?
She snatches up the can across from her and takes a long sip.
Coffee.
What kind of coffee?
Coffee is coffee. I don’t drink sugary junk.
And, for the record, it’s obnoxious to challenge someone that you don’t know to a match.
Is it really such a big deal? All I wanted was a practice game.
Do you know those types that stream snipe and start shit on message boards so that people pay attention to them?
All too well, unfortunately.
That's you. Except you did it in real life.
Bolt's a real tool though, isn't he? What kind of prick........ Tch.
Jett cuts herself off with a hiss and grits her teeth.
How do you know him? His name is Bolt?
Yes. He plays for Shock T1.
Shock, huh? Bolt must be a new recruit. I haven’t paid much attention to them or any other Brood War team since StarCraft 2 came out, but he definitely wasn't on their roster a year ago.
Right. But how do you know him?
Jett clicks her tongue and breaks her gaze away from me. I silently appreciate the reprieve from her death glare.
If you must know, he and I went to the same middle school. I was in the class above him.
Oh, okay. I was thinking he might have knocked you out of a tournament or something.
No. I've never played him in a StarLeague. You don’t need to overanalyze everything.
Silence falls between us while Jett nurses what remains of her drink. I can’t tell if she’s really into the coffee or if she’s just trying to find something to occupy her lips other than our conversation.
I doubt Jett spends much time at PC bangs given that she's got a team house to practice from. I should consider myself lucky that she'd make time to come out here at all.
You know it makes zero sense for you to focus on qualifying for VSL, right?
I blink myself from my thoughts to meet Jett's intense stare.
What do you mean? What’s the point of us meeting up to practice then?
No. I'm not saying— Listen.
I want to round up some players.
For what?
For VSTL.
Team league? But you’re already on a team.
Yeah.
Yeah?
She wavers, considering whether or not to tell me what I’ve already figured out.
You’re leaving VIP?
Jett’s eyes jump to mine, brows raised in surprise and then furrowed in annoyance. She’s been on VIP for almost a year and is by far the team's best player.
Management barely pays us and nobody is motivated. They're worse than bad, they're complacent. I want a fresh start.
I’m not guilting you. It just isn’t something I expected to hear. Do you have a team house picked out?
No. Not yet.
What about a coach?
... No.
Um, well, do you have players in mind?
Look! It’s a work in progress, okay?!
I edge away from her glare and raise my hands defensively.
Err, alright! Sorry, it's not my business.
For awhile, silence. Jett does her best to avoid eye contact, but I can tell she’s thinking hard about something.
Just as I'm about to rise to replace my milk tea with another, she speaks.
You know about all of those new foreign teams popping up recently, right?
Err, yeah. What about them?
Isn't it strange? They're worse than almost every Korean squad, yet most of them have more sponsors.
Well, there are a lot of eSports fans outside of Korea these days. People want to support their hometown heroes.
I don't think it's that simple.
Where would the money come from if not the fans?
Idiots.
Er, what?
Idiots. Idiots that call themselves investors. Idiots that throw away money keeping mediocre players afloat because it makes them feel good inside for whatever reason.
Well, she and Bolt agree on one thing, at least.
Um. Okay. Are you going to find some idiots to sponsor you?
No... 
Well.
She takes a long moment to reconsider her answer.
... No. It wouldn't work out in the end.
What I'm getting at is that too much of our scene ignores the foreign fanbase. It's a huge mistake.
Well, there's the time zone difference and a language barrier. Also, I don't know if you know this, but lots of foreign fans don't find Korean players entertaining.
What?! How dare you! That's ridiculous!
I'm just relaying common knowledge! Don't hold me accountable for the opinions of silver-leaguers.
Most Western fan support goes to the people who entertain well. Streamers, casters. Those kind of people.
The most famous players in your scene aren't the best? That's appalling.
Hey, Brood War got popular on the backs of boys that looked good on camera. That's practically the same thing! If the PC bang was the ship, then the fangirls pulled the oars.
Not the same thing. They were pretty and skilled, not one or the other.
And show some damn respect, those 'boys' are the only reason that you and I are able to have this conversation.
The sharp response and equally sharp glare suggests that I shouldn't argue the point. Jett knows better than I do anyway.
We're getting off topic. There are tons of potential fans that most Korean teams ignore simply because they're too hard to connect with.
Yeah. I agree.
She lifts an eyebrow and stares at me for just a bit too long before glancing away. If I wasn't sure before, I am now.
Go on.
Go on and what?
I know what you’re thinking.
No you don't.
Yes I do.
What am I thinking, then?
You want me to join a new team you're starting so that I can help you with the foreign fanbase.
Also, you invited me here to tryout under the guise of practice.
...
.....................
Jett slumps back in her seat, defeated. I fight a losing battle against the urge to laugh.
Don't look so smug. Ugh, I hate dealing with team management.
You could hire a manager.
Before we have any players? Maybe I should just keep my head down and practice.
No, don’t do that. It's a good idea.
You’re only saying that because I gave you an offer.
Partially. But if you go through with this, I’ll do whatever I can to help.
How are you the one convincing me to go after my own idea? Dammit.
She chews on her lip, likely considering the harrowing risk of leaving her team.
... I can’t make any commitments until we at least have some other players. It’d be stupid for me to move out of the VIP house without everything lined up.
This is something I’ve been thinking about for a while, even if I don’t have every detail hashed out yet.
I want to keep overhead low and practice time high. Lean and mean.
She aims a finger at me, her dull nail a hair’s breadth before my nose.
If you're going to be a part of this, you're going to pull your weight. You can start by searching for our players, unless you’d rather find me a coach and sponsor.
I cringe backwards and raise my hands.
No, no. Uh. I’ll leave that to you.
Good. It’ll work out better this way. The minimum number of players for team league is four, so you need to find at least two.
You know, this isn’t exactly how I envisioned that I'd join a StarCraft team.
Walk away if you like. You have a long way to go if you want to be anything other than our translator mascot anyway.
I'll admit though, Accel was right. I see glimpses of high level stuff in your play.
But as of right now, you kind of suck, even by foreigner standards. Offense intended.
You seriously need to start busting your ass. Coming to Korea is pointless if you're still practicing Western hours.
Well. Nobody ever claimed that Jett wasn't honest.
I’m going to work you and everyone else like dogs. If this team comes together, I won't be happy with anything less than first place in VSTL.
Well. I appreciate the chance.
I offer a smile that she's quick to match.
If we're going ahead with this, I've got a lot of stuff to do. The deadline to register for team league is in two weeks, so we can’t afford to waste time. Get moving on your search.
Alright. Good luck. I’ll catch you online.
Yeah. Later.
When she's gone, I fall back into my chair and take a deep breath.
Jett just asked me to join her team.
I pinch my forearm and judge the sensation that follows. With that, my disbelief dissolves into contemplation.
... How the hell am I going to find two worthwhile, unsigned players?
A mixture of guilt and pride led me to spend the rest of the day at Golden Zonefire. Between ladder games and a break for dinner, I scoped out the cafe’s best StarCraft players.
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like any of Golden Zonefire’s regular patrons are much to write home about. There were good players there for All-Out Attack, sure, but today...
Most of the cafe's patrons were playing Brood War. And of the ones that were actually laddering in StarCraft 2, there was only a single guy in master league.
I’ll have to extend my search outside of a single PC bang. I guess it'd have been a little too convenient to find a VSL-caliber player so easily.
I get the urge to stop at a convenience store on the way back to my apartment. There’s one I've been going to regularly for my nightly fix of sugar and caffeine.
The store’s blindingly bright signage is visible from more than a block away. Green capital letters spell out the store’s name in English on a backdrop of white. Go-Mart.
The door’s familiar chime welcomes me, and the same clerk I’ve seen at least a dozen times before stands formally behind a cash register.
He looks a bit old to be working still. Maybe he owns the place and doesn't have help to work the night shift?
I see myself standing behind the counter in an unwanted mental image. It's a fate that could easily await me if I fail to make it as a professional gamer.
I shake my head free of the thought and make my way to the refrigerated section of the store to fill my fists with cans and bottles.
Some of the drinks may have strange names, but I’ll be damned if they aren’t good.
I drop them on the counter in front of the old man and briefly make eye contact with him. He seems to recognize me, but doesn’t say anything to indicate it.
He rings up my drinks slowly, not from age or callouses, but because he's in no great rush. The store's empty aside from me, after all.
6,000 won.
I swipe my credit card in the reader and depart with a polite smile, anxious to return to my apartment.
The clerk returns the expression and watches me go without another word.
The only top-tier player I’m on speaking terms with is Accel, but how would I even approach the subject of getting him to leave his team for a new and untested one?
Maybe it would be better for me to simply get a lead from him. If I can’t manage that, then I’m left to scour local PC bangs and message boards on my own.
Whatever. I'll figure this out tomorrow.
And you had to convince her? Seriously? She’s been talking this up to me for the past two months.
It’s a big change, plus I just met you guys. I'd be hesitant too.
Hmm!
Accel grins, no doubt replaying Jett’s angst in his mind’s eye.
Getting in at the ground floor is a major plus. You were in the right place at the right time. If it works out, that is.
Accel glances over his shoulder before returning his attention to me.
Most teams barely pay their players anything. I’ve got it good for someone my age, but even I have part of my winnings taken for the team’s benefit.
Ouch. Luckily for Westerners, that isn’t a trend that has caught on outside of South Korea.
So...
.......
... I can’t do it. It’s impossible. The words simply will not come.
What?
... Oh!
Accel lets out a laugh, genuine and highly amused. He tries to get his words out and, unlike me, eventually ends up succeeding.
Sorry Mach, but no can do. I’m signed with Crash until the end of the year. I’m not allowed to play for anyone else until my contract is up.
As I expected. Really, it shouldn’t come as a surprise. I sigh, fall back into my chair, and rest my palms atop my head.
I had to ask. Jett’s expecting me to pick up our players while she handles the management and sponsorship side of things.
Hey, well. I can help you with the next best thing.
I’d be thankful for any help at all.
Don’t you worry. I’ve got a shortlist of easy pick-ups. An extremely short list.
He clears his throat.
There’s only one person on it. But hey! Better than nothing, right?
Who is it?
Ooh, straight to business. Eager for your bunkbed, I see. Trust me Mach, you’ll want the bottom bunk.
You know from experience?
Sure do. When I was sixteen, some upjumped Brood War clan scraped me from the bottom of the barrel and set me up in their overcrowded sweatshop of a team house.
Had to sleep above someone at least two years past a graceful retirement. I’ve seen solitaire players with better APM. He snored. A lot.
As horrible as he’s trying to make it seem, Accel sounds closer to wistful than bitter as he recounts his first years as a professional gamer.
What happened to the team?
Sponsor flaked. Team didn't have the money for legal action.
Coach didn't tell us until twenty minutes before rent was due. Someone stole my mousepad as we were moving out. And that was the end of my StarCraft career.
Wait, no, it kept going for seven years after that and somehow still isn't over. Always forget that part.
Accel. Top Korean terran, master storyteller.
Anyway. This guy's name is Stunt. Plays protoss. He's pretty good.
... But?
But? Does there have to be a but?
I’m sensing a but.
It’s a small but. He’s incredibly cheesy and maybe a touch arrogant. And he's a high schooler. But, he's good.
Why haven't any other teams picked him up in that case?
He shrugs. I get the feeling that Accel genuinely doesn’t know, but I'm left anxious nonetheless. 
Still, it’s important to have at least some kind of racial distribution on the team.
... Not in terms of foreigner or Korean mind you, but rather of zerg, protoss, and terran.
Hm. Do you know how I could get in touch with him?
I could give you his info for a friend request, but he’d probably block you on the assumption that you’re a goldseller or something.
Your best bet is to find him in person at Stomping Grounds.
... His stomping grounds? What do you mean? Where?
No, no. Stomping Grounds. That’s the name of the PC bang he’s usually at.
Ugh. Another trek across Seoul. I’ve never heard of the place, much less been to it. Accel takes note of my frown and wags a finger at me.
What, you fly halfway across the world and can’t be bothered to walk for half an hour? Take the subway if you’re that lazy.
No, no. It’s fine. I shouldn’t expect this to be easy.
Now we’re talking. Get going. I’ll keep an eye out for your next player in the meantime.
I check the map on my phone for the second time after reading the sign for a third. This is definitely Stomping Grounds.
A deep breath helps calm my nerves. Seconds later, I push open the glass door and make my way inside.
Pretty much as expected. Computers, vending machines, tables, and the sound of two dozen mice and keyboards. PC bangs are nothing if not similar to one another.
When a shiver runs down my back, I realize that the A/C in here is cranked up ridiculously high.
I read somewhere that casinos pump in extra oxygen to keep their patrons awake and alert. Maybe this place has tried to adapt the same tactic to their cafe?
A middle aged woman sits behind the front desk. She glances up at me when I pass by and then returns her attention to the magazine splayed out in front of her.
A quick scan of heads lined up in front of monitors offers me a few potential Stunts amidst the sea of scrubs. By Accel’s description, he’s short and has bleached hair.
I’m able to narrow it down quickly and confirm his identity with a look at his monitor. He’s in the middle of ladder match.
… And he’s playing StarCraft 2 with one hand. The other is occupied with a game on his cell phone.
All the same, Stunt's crushing his opponent with a rush build. And by the look on his face, he takes great pleasure in that fact.
His enemy sends a salty one liner before dropping out of the game without a gg. Stunt grins wide and puts his hands behind his head, satisfied.
After checking the post-game stats, he glances over his shoulder and then spins his chair around to find me watching him.
Sup. Something you want?
Yeah. You're Stunt, right?
That's me. And who are you?
I'm Mach.
Stunt lights up, stands upright, and plants his hands on his hips all at once.
Right! The foreigner that Accel messaged me about. Was starting to think you wouldn’t show up. Let’s get this betmatch going.
HEY EVERYONE! THE BETMATCH IS ON!
What.
... Dammit. Really Accel?
Before I can attempt an explanation, a crowd of six or seven middle school-aged kids forms behind Stunt. I don’t see myself talking my way out of this.
Betmatch. Right. That’s me, yes. That’s what I’m here for.
A foreign girl is going up against Stunt? Is this a betmatch or a donation?!
When will they learn? He's the cafe’s best player! Hey Stunt, will you buy me a juice with your winnings?
Stunt ignores the peanut gallery and takes a step forward, sizing me up. Judging by his appearance, it looks like he just started high school. I’m almost a head taller than him.
Accel said you were down for a fifteen thousand won bet, but c’mon. You can do better than that, right?
How much were you thinking?
Twenty-five thousand is a much better number, wouldn’t you say? C’mon, you had to drag your ass all the way over here to play. Let's make it interesting.
That’s what, twenty dollars or so? I’d have to skip a few trips to Go-Mart, but I can’t risk having him turn me down.
Okay, fine. Twenty-five thousand. What are we going to do about maps? Best of three, right?
Nah, best of one is fine. My time’s too valuable. And in a show of good faith, you can pick the map.
Accel wasn’t kidding about this kid's cockiness. Whatever, at least I can choose a map with a long rush distance.
I find a seat at a computer nearby, though not so close that we could catch a glimpse at one another’s screen.
A locked window stares back at me as I sit down—of course, I need to pay to use the PC. But before I can head back to the front desk, Stunt slides in front of me and takes the mouse.
Yo, I got it. Consider it an investment for the money you’re about to give me.
He unlocks the machine with a few clicks and the entry of a password. Huh, that works.
After I thank him, he slinks back over to his setup. Stunt shares a few confident words with the underage crowd behind him and then throws his headphones on.
I host up a game and toss him an invite. It’s not long after that I’m staring down my base and six workers.
My mouse creaks under my grip before I release it and push away from the PC.
Even though I was mentally prepared for a rush, he made it work anyway. What a stupid loss.
Judging by the swagger in Stunt’s walk as he makes his way over to me, he either doesn’t notice the frustration I’m feeling or doesn’t care.
Heh, easy. I call that one the Stunt Special.
I rub my forehead. Admittedly, the kid is pretty good. Accel was right to put me on his trail.
Right, time to pay up.
Oh, yeah. So listen, I’m thinking of start--
I reach for my wallet mid-sentence and then freeze. It's not there.
Hold up.
I pat down all my pockets to discover that I simply don't have it. Did I leave it back at my apartment? I didn’t know I was showing up to a betmatch!
... Are you serious? You don’t have any money?
With a blanched expression, I confirm his suspicion with a nod.
I can explain this, really. I didn’t know I was showing up to a betmatch. Accel put me on your trail because I’m recruiting for a new team.
With a gaggle of middle schoolers egging him on with jeers, he thumbs his nose at me.
You’re just trying to get out of paying for your loss. That’s low. Real low.
You couldn’t hold my all-in and don’t bring your wallet to a betmatch, and I’m supposed to expect you to organize a team? Yeah, I don’t think so.
Stunt, wait. We’ve got—
Shit. Jett is technically still on VIP… Can I tell him that she’s planning to leave? What if he tells someone? Why didn’t I think of this ahead of time!?
We… have some good players about to sign and a sponsor in the works. Nothing official, we’re trying to keep everything under wraps until then.
Yeah, people have tried this sketchy shit with me before. It’s not happening. I paid for your PC, and now you repay me with this crap? Get lost, lady.
Wait! This is a great opportunity, I’m serious!
But any hope I have of getting Stunt to change his mind is drowned out by the boos of the middle schooler cadre.
You suck! You lost to Stunt, he’s the best!
Loser! Now he can’t buy me a juice!
Pay up, loser!
I glance past the chest-high crowd to search out Stunt, but it’s too late. He’s gone.
How did I mess this up so bad?
Stunt pushes through the dumbfounded crowd and comes stomping over, fury in his eyes. He really didn’t expect to lose.
YOU BLINDLY SCOUT THE SMOKE IN YOUR BASE!? AFTER A CANNON RUSH!? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! WHO DOES THAT?!
I raise my hands defensively and skirt away from the victory screen splashed across my monitor.
Woah, woah! Calm down. It takes like five seconds. And you have a reputation for those kind of builds, you know.
He makes a disgruntled sound and stares hard at me.
You got lucky! Typical terran players. And I'm taking back my—
What are you yelling back there for? Didn’t I tell you to sweep up the backroom an hour ago? Stop screaming at our customers and go do something useful! Lord have mercy!
Without warning, the woman at the front desk paints Stunt a bright red from across the room.
She glares at him for a moment longer before ducking back behind the counter. Talk about lousy bosses.
His anger replaced with modesty, Stunt scratches behind his head. The middle-schoolers have mostly dispersed, evidently destroyed by the cruel realization that their protoss god can bleed.
... Ehh. Sorry. That’s my mom. Anyway, you beat me. Lemme go get your cash.
His mom? Egh, even worse. I guess I can see the resemblance, minus the bleached hair. Explains how he unlocked my PC, at least.
Actually, wait. I didn’t come here for a betmatch.
What? But we just played one.
... I don’t have to pay you then?
What? No. I’m recruiting for a new team. Accel mentioned that you were a free agent, and I wanted to see if you’d join up.
I guess he thought it’d be funny to trick me into a betmatch with you.
A foreign team? Why didn’t you just send me a message or something?
No, a Korean one. And Accel said you’d probably assume I was a fangirl and block me. Although, I get the feeling that was just an excuse for this whole setup...
Couldn't we have just kept this simple? What if I had lost?!
Stunt pauses and reaches for his phone. Distracted or no, he manages to carry on the conversation.
Nah, blocking you sounds like something I’d do. Anyway, who else have you got?
We’ve got—
Wait. Jett is technically still on VIP… Can I tell him that she’s planning to leave? What if he tells someone? Why didn’t I think of this ahead of time!?
You've got...?
We… have some good players about to sign and a sponsor in the works. Nothing official, we’re keeping everything under wraps until then.
Sounds sketchy. A mystery sponsor and mystery players.
He doesn’t seem convinced. I can hardly blame him. This sort of thing is unfortunately common in eSports.
But Accel did vouch for you. That’s worth something. And you beat me, the future protoss bonjwa.
Once we’ve got four players and some management, we’re going to pick out a team house. You'll need to live and practice with us.
I blink once, look away, and take a tactical pause.
Oh, uh, if your mom will let you move out, that is.
He rises to my bait and straightens up, both fists clenched.
You're damn right she's going to let me!
Alright, consider me signed. If I've got a room and enough money to pay for food, we’re in business.
Stunt pauses and lowers himself from the tips of his toes.
What’s the team called, by the way?
Like I said, it’s a work in progress. I’ll let you know when it’s picked out.
If we’re not named yet, I want a say in it.
How about AzureBlaze Phoenix Snipers?
What even...? Kid, this isn't a shonen anime.
Yeah. Probably not.
While Stunt revels in the afterglow of being signed to a StarCraft team, a thought occurs to me.
Wait, don’t you go to school?
Uhh. Let's just say I'm between schools right now.
I don’t bother trying to divulge anymore information. If he can live in the team house and perform, that's good enough for me.
Some promising young pros deferred school for Brood War back in the day. And if StarCraft doesn’t work out for him, at least he's got a future cleaning up Stomping Grounds.
Right. The mysteries won’t last for long, I promise. I’ll be in touch if I need you to show up somewhere.
Okay. I’m going to hit you up for practice games tonight, if that’s cool. Be online.
Sounds good. Welcome aboard.
The fiery protoss player lifts his chin for a final grin before heading into one of the PC bang’s back rooms, probably to gather a broom and dustpan.
I grace Stunt’s mom with an innocent expression on my way out. She answers my smile with a glare sharp enough to make the hair on the back of my neck stand up.
I step outside and suck in a deep breath, relieved. The warm, afternoon air is sweet and feels good in my lungs.
One down.
The stairway to my apartment was empty as usual. Sometimes it feels like I’m the only person living in this building.
Isolation was a major concern when I was first thinking about coming overseas. If my Korean wasn’t passable, it’d practically impossible for me to be anything but lonely.
That's something I don't need to worry about anymore, I suppose. Seoul's proven to be vibrant, crowded, and busy. Everything my life back home wasn’t.
Something as simple as crossing the street can be exciting for someone who has never been in an urban environment for more than a few hours at a time. It sounds stupid, but it’s true.
Still, before meeting Accel and Jett, I barely talked to anyone offline. StarCraft’s one on one nature doesn’t exactly lend itself to social introductions.
It'd be easy to get in touch with the foreigner community out here. But I have very little desire to skulk around bars with jaded English teachers and washed-up businessmen. Why bother?
I sink into my chair and jam the spacebar a few times to wake up my PC. I practiced enough at Golden Zonefire after recruiting Stunt, so I don’t bother loading up StarCraft.
Jett was pleased to hear about my new pickup. Told me it was smart to hold off on telling Stunt who she was, too.
I’m sure she’ll announce her plans on her own time. She’ll have to once we’ve picked up our last player at any rate.
With a few clicks I’m staring at a common StarCraft fan site. The most interesting stuff that goes on in the scene gets posted here, and what people vote as best rises to the top of the page.
I don’t often visit the Korean community sites. I like them just fine, but I prefer to read English when I get the chance.
But no matter where you choose to get your StarCraft news, you’ll find no shortage of netizens sure in their opinions on which player is awful or why the game is imbalanced.
Today seems to be no exception. A foreign pro-gamer just called it quits, and the comments about him are ridiculously scathing.
Sure, he was underperforming recently. But people forget just how much time and passion gets put into even a mediocre professional’s career.
The worst part is that most of the people talking smack are either low leaguers or don’t play the game at all.
I take out my phone, hoping to find something on it to distract me from the mindless masses. No texts, no new emails. Same as when I last checked fifteen minutes ago.
It’s been awhile since I’ve chatted with my friends from back home. Most of them know about my eSports aspirations, but none of them really get it.
There’s two reactions when someone learns that you play video games full time: Either they roll their eyes, or they tell you how lucky you are.
I’ve tried to explain to the latter that playing StarCraft really isn’t fun in the traditional sense. Winning can be satisfying, but the game is too stressful to actually be called fun. At least, for me.
It beats a boring minimum wage job, but it sure as hell isn’t easy and pays less for all but the best. Yeah, they don't mention that between games on StarLeague streams.
Pretty much everyone I went to high school with is enrolled in college. When I hear about their great social lives and internships, I can't help but feel jealous.
I’ll probably end up going eventually. It’s not like I can make a living from games when I’m thirty.
Five or six years of StarCraft, and then you’re left with the dregs of your prize money and sore wrists. And hopefully some friends and fond memories.
With a look back at the computer screen, I notice that my inbox has a message awaiting. A click, and I’m staring and at a piece of hatemail, one of several I’ve already received this month.
It's something I've had to deal with for pretty much my entire life, but things really amped up when my stream hit five hundred viewers for the first time.
There's not much to say other than that I'm used to this sort of thing by now. I quit streaming to focus on improving for my own sake, not for the idiots that send me shit like this.
At least, that's what I tell myself. It's hard to know for sure.
Most of the people who follow StarCraft know less about the game itself than they do about the people playing it. I don't like that I'm expected to constantly bear the scrunity of strangers.
The community is what keeps the scene alive. I know it's wrong to loathe it. But simply knowing that doesn't make it any easier not to.
With an impatient click, my PC groans off. I climb under my sheets and settle in for an early night’s rest.
The search continues tomorrow.
I wake to the sound of rain against my window. Judging by the light, it's morning.
It dawns on me that I was supposed to play Stunt in a few practice games last night. Whoops. Probably not a great move to blow off the player I just recruited.
Breakfast this morning is cold as usual, or at least since I took a chance on some street food. 
It was actually pretty good, but I ended up sick for a few days. I’ve stuck with cereal in the mornings since then.
I hope everything is working out on Jett’s end. Good management and even a single sponsor will take us a long way. 
All I can do is focus on the task at hand: finding talent.
I put away my bowl once I’ve emptied it and lock my apartment on the way out.
My jacket's hood held up against the rain for most of the way, but my hair ended up soaked in the end.
I shake my head dry once I'm inside, much to the annoyance of the guy at Golden Zonefire's front desk.
The cafe is largely empty on most weekdays, at least before schools let out. 
With a bit of searching, I find Accel reclined drowsily in a computer chair that he must have wheeled over to the lounge area. 
I'll bet he'd rather be sleeping in at the Crash team house, but Accel said that he didn’t have time to meet me any later.
He yawns and waves me over. I pull up a chair from a nearby PC and sit beside him—plenty to choose from when the place is this empty.
Do they not have umbrellas outside of Korea?
No. Everyone just sprints from place to place if it rains.
Ha. So, anyway, Stunt agreed?
Yeah. It’ll make the next pick-up even easier since I’ve actually got another player to point to. I wish Jett would hurry up and ditch her team already.
Accel raises an eyebrow and shakes his head at me.
She can’t do that yet. Jett has a contract.
It has to be over soon though, right? Why else would she be putting together a team if she wouldn’t be able to play on it?
They vary, but most contracts last either six months or a year. Best case scenario, she’ll be free at the end of the month.
That makes sense. The Victory StarLeague won’t let anyone with a contract play without their team's approval, but maybe there’s no rule against registering ahead of time?
Whatever, I’m sure that Jett has this figured out already.
Right. Anyway, you said you’ve got a lead on the next player, yeah?
Yep. Guy named Reva. Flits in and out of top eight on the ladder. He’s won at least a dozen online tournaments this year.
Wow. What race does he play?
Here’s the best part. He plays all three. His terran is his strongest, but he’s been known to switch between races during a long set. He'll even play random.
Reva plays zerg, terran, and protoss? Woah. That sounds too good to be true.
But this is where it gets weird. He’s never turned up to a tournament in person. Only plays online. Some people speculate that Reva is just an alias for a top player.
I’m not convinced, though.
He’s got a very specific playstyle. It’s almost like playing against a highly advanced A.I. Strong mechanically, but only goes for standard macro games.
So how am I going to get in touch with him? Other teams have to have gone after a player that good.
It won’t be easy, but I’ve got a plan.
Not another betmatch, please…
Heh. It worked, didn’t it? No, no. Not this time.
Reva’s on a mean win streak in an online king of the hill. Twelve wins in a row.
Granted, most of his games have been against foreigners. It's based in Europe so it's at a weird hour for us...
Point is, you’re going to enter tonight.
Tonight? So I beat him, and then use that to convince him to join the team?
Hold on. I didn’t say anything about beating him. I mean, if you do, I’m not going to complain.
You’re going to play an 
honorable macro game.
Reva hates anything that’s non-standard. Cheese, rushes, aggressive timings, all-ins, one-base builds... That sort of thing. So you're going to play a slow, economy-based game instead.
But if I play a game in the exact style he’s used to, won't I get stomped?
Maybe. But it’s your only chance to get on his good side. Play him, show off your skill, chat him up, and recruit him.
You make it sound so easy.
Hey, find your own players if you don’t like it. I’m sure there are tons of strategy forum scrubs willing to tryout.
He does have a point. Guess I’m staying in tonight.
Fair enough. By the way, what are you so busy with this afternoon?
Team league practice. Gotta drill a zerg of ours to snipe the Team KaiNE terran ace.
The match is half a week away. Until then, practice, practice, practice. That’s how we do it.
Beneath his easy facade, I can tell that Accel doesn’t seem too pleased by the circumstance.
Right then. Any final tips against Reva before I go practice for tonight?
Yeah. Hope you like mech.
It's all I can do not to groan.
My favorite.
The admin said it shouldn’t be more than five minutes now. Reva just got finished extending his record to thirteen wins.
I’m already warmed up from practicing all day, so there’s no point of loading up a map to drill my micro or anything like that. 
The only thing I’ve got to focus on before the game is my build and my nerves.
Most players, myself included, tend to get a little bit jittery before a high stakes match. 
It’s a more serious issue at live events with all the lights and cameras and cheering fans, but it can happen in an online setting just as easily.
This king of the hill is broadcast on a commentated livestream. The channel hosting it isn’t particularly popular, but the exposure can’t hurt.
Unless I get beat really, really badly.
Looks like the game is getting started. In the pre-game lobby, Reva remains utterly silent even after I offer a friendly glgl.
Whatever. Let’s get this going.
Phew. That didn’t go so bad. Reva went down a little easier than I expected, though.
Does this mean I need to continue with the King of the Hill? I hadn’t considered that. Gotta wrap up a conversation with Reva quickly in that case.
I open up a chat and fire off a message.
gg. lucky hard counter for me lolol;;
… Nothing.
Even after thirty seconds, there’s still no response. Adamantly, I try once more.
hey listen, you play pretty well. would you be interested in some practice?
What follows my second message is not a response, but a notification that Reva has gone offline.
What! What is this guy in such a hurry for? Because I rushed him?! How the hell am I supposed to get into contact with this guy now?
I think to ask through one of the tournament organizers for him to unblock me. But before I can do so, I receive an invite to the next game.
In the pre-game lobby, my new opponent takes a few subtle jabs at my strategy from last game.
keke, you haven’t watched this koth’s stream before have you?
? no, why
take my advice, dont cheese again if you like your reputation ^^
Rather than pry an answer out of this stranger, I decide to turn on the stream and see what he’s talking about for myself.
… And I find that the casters are talking trash about me. Seriously? Just because I did a rush build?
What kind of arrogant assholes are these commentators? Screw this. If Reva couldn’t handle a rush and frequents a King of the Hill like this, then why would I bother recruiting him?
Frustrated, I make my opponent aware that I’m forfeiting the match and shut off my PC in a huff.
Okay… Can’t screw this up. I pop open a chatbox and fire off a message.
your macro is too good lolol
For a while, no response. But just when I’ve given up hope that he’ll message me back...
Thank you. You play well. You made only a few key mistakes.
Perfect capitalization and grammar? Ugh, whenever anyone does this to me, I feel obligated to fix my typing. 
Screw it, I’m way too tired after forty minutes of positional play.
oh ya? well thanks. im actually looking for some practice partners, kinda.
Kind of? How?
well, im starting a team with a few friends. we’re gonna try to qualify for team league.
I see.
im actually looking to pick up another player atm. would you be interested?
For almost ten seconds, nothing. Each second ticking by feels longer than the last. But then...
I am willing to discuss the possibility.
oh awesome, we’re gonna meet up at golden zonefire tomorrow afternoon. you’re in seoul, ya? you know where it is?
Oh. You wish to meet in person?
C’mon! I’ve already come this far! Keep it together!
ya just gonna hang with the team and practice a bit. we’re nice, I swear.
Another pause, this time longer. I find myself drawing closer and closer to the screen in anticipation of Reva’s reply.
Very well. I will see you and your teammates at Golden Zonefire tomorrow. How do you suggest I find you?
kk. look for the foreigner lol.
I will do so. Goodbye.
With that, Reva exits our chat and prepares for his next king of the hill match.
Did I do it? Did I recruit our last player? Can I celebrate yet?
No. Better to wait. I mean, he’s never even been to an event in person before. There’s a chance that he won’t show.
I step out of my chair and fall onto my bed, simultaneously tired and restless. I shut my eyes, but there’s no way I’m going to sleep tonight with this hanging over my head.
Maybe I should go to Go-Mart. It’s not a good idea to drink caffeinated stuff this late at night, but a walk might get my mind off of the stress.
Since meeting Accel and Jett, the pangs of homesickness haven’t been nearly as bad.
Should I feel guilty that I only want to update my old friends or my parents now that I’ve actually got something going my way? Is it better to keep these small victories to myself?
When was the last time I even spoke English? I honestly can’t remember.
I never had to move around or switch schools when I was a kid, but maybe this is the same thing. You find a group and stick with it. Keeping in touch with your old friends becomes too difficult.
It could be a good thing. More focus on making my eSports career work than on what so and so switched his major to.
I can’t help but feel a little unsure. Putting my old life down isn’t easy knowing that I’ll have to pick it back up eventually.
My thoughts of home fade as the green and white signage comes into view.
The old man is behind the counter as always, this time restocking the shelf on his side beneath the cash register.
I take my usual fare from the refrigerators in the back of the store and step to the counter. The clerk’s haggard eyes linger on me for a moment before he returns to his shelf-stocking.
Just a moment.
I’m in no rush so I answer him with a nod. I let the drinks rest on the laminated counter and turn to take a closer look at the convenience store.
It’s compact and clean, like pretty much everything else in Seoul. If it has any employees other than the old man on duty, I don’t see them.
Most stores don't have foreign snacks or drinks aside from their localized variants, and Go-Mart is no exception to that. I’ve had to be bold in trying new food.
Just as I'm about to step towards a bag of strange looking trail mix, the clerk’s voice sounds from behind.
You’ve been in here quite often, haven’t you?
I turn, surprised. He’s staring right at me.
Err, yeah. I’m not… That’s okay, isn’t it?
He pauses in surprise, likely at my language proficiency, and then presses right on.
More than okay. Those drinks don’t buy themselves. What’s your name?
I'm Mach... Uh, wait a second. That's not right.
Strangely enough, I haven’t had to share my real name with anyone since I came overseas. It feels unfamiliar on my tongue as I prepare to correct myself.
But before I can, the clerk furrows his eyebrows at me.
Mach? That doesn’t sound like any kind of foreign name I’ve heard before.
How am I in this situation? Dammit.
It’s hard to explain. Um, do you know what StarCraft is?
The elderly cashier’s eyes light up in understanding.
I’ve heard of it. You’re a pro-gamer then?
Yeah. Working at it, at least.
I suppose that explains your late night shopping trips. How long have you been in Seoul?
A little more than a month. I like it here.
Good. It’s a fine city.
You can call me Mr. Yeon, by the way. It's good to meet you, Mach.
I simply nod and then look away. I'm not particularly good at talking to strangers about anything other than StarCraft.
The conversation between us doesn’t lead anywhere else, so he starts ringing up my drinks. With the bottles bagged and offered, he smiles.
Take care now.
I make my way back to my apartment for an evening of StarCraft and little sleep.
Remind me why we have to meet up here again? I get to play for free at my mom’s, you know.
And you probably get yelled at if the toilet clogs up too.
Stunt rolls his eyes and pulls out his cell phone, thumb soon jamming away at some weird puzzle game.
What is it exactly that you're always playing on your phone?
I'm glad you asked! It's called PopPop Safari. It's one of those casual games meant to sucker morons out of their money.
And you're playing it why...?
It's my own way of fighting back against something I hate. I'm going to defeat this game in its entirety without paying a single cent!
I don't understand how that stops anything. They're still making money from everyone else, aren't they?
I steal a glance at his phone.
... And there are tons of ads all over your screen. Look.
You don't understand. It's about the principle!
And I wouldn't be playing it in the first place if this dude had showed up when you said he would.
Admittedly, Reva should be here by now, but I can’t do anything except wait for him to arrive.
I texted back and forth with Jett a bit earlier today. She’s too busy wrapping things up with her contact to make it to Golden Zonefire until way later. 
From the tone of her messages, it seemed like talks with the sponsor were going well.
With word that I managed to pick out our fourth player, she gave me the go ahead to divulge her identity to Stunt and Reva. Helpful, since we still have a coach and practice partners to recruit.
I hear the door to Golden Zonefire slide open and I glance over, hopeful.
... Only to find a bespectacled girl walk inside and look around. Tch, no dice. Where the hell is he?
The girl stands at the cafe's entryway for a while, apparently searching for something. Eventually, her eyes catch and then stay on me.
Huh. It looks like she’s coming our way.
Stunt glances up from his cell phone once I turn to address the newcomer. She hesitates before speaking and delivers her words quietly.
Excuse me, are you Mach?
Oh, hi. That’s me.
I apologize for the delay. I disembarked the subway a stop too early. Is this one of the teammates that you mentioned?
She shifts her focus from me to Stunt. His expression is no doubt as perplexed as my own. Is she…?
Wait a second. Are you Reva?
Yes, I am.
Oh, I’m sorry! I didn’t realize that you were also... Uh, I just assumed...
I trail off quietly. If the mix-up bothered Reva, she doesn’t show it. She tilts her head slightly and edges closer to our table.
May I sit?
Of course. Reva, this is Stunt. He’s the team’s only protoss.
Sup.
He silences the obnoxious bleeps and bloops of his phone’s game in his pocket and bobs his head at Reva.
Reva, huh? Doesn’t sound too familiar. You must be some online hero.
Stunt. I am familiar with you.
Eh? How? 
I mean, of course you are! I'm the god of protoss after all!
No. We have matched on ladder several times. Your play is predictable and unproductive.
Woah, hey! To expand is to give mercy, barcode scum! Don’t be a hater.
You should aspire to more than rush builds and gimmicks. The meta no longer favors aggressive play.
Mach, you didn’t tell me that this chick was so uptight. Is the rest of the team this lame?
Both of them rest their eyes on me, expectant. Now or never, I guess.
You won’t need to worry about lackluster teammates. Jett is actually the one who’s setting this whole thing up.
Jett?!
That's right.
With crossed arms, I beam a confident grin at the two of them. Stunt wears a mixture of surprise and excitement, while Reva seems to simply be processing the development.
But isn’t she on VIP?
For now. But she’s not happy with her practice environment or how much they’re paying her, so she’s not going to renew her contract at the end of the month.
Interesting.
Reva pushes her glasses against the bridge of her nose, silent. Stunt looks like he wants to simultaneously call me a liar and a genius.
How exactly did you end up recruiting for Jett? It’s not like she has any need for some mediocre foreigner.
Mediocre foreigner that slapped down your terrible cheese build, Stunt. And I’ll be the first to admit I’m lucky to sit where I am. The same is true for the two of you.
Practice hard and maybe we can make something of ourselves and this team. Sound good?
I’m in no way the captain of this squad, so it feels a little weird to take such an authoritative tone. Still, Stunt backs down and dons a thoughtful expression.
Yeah, alright. You’re right. This could be big.
I agree. Your offer had piqued my interest, but word that a player as accomplished as Jett will be among us has secured it. I will join.
Perfect. She’ll be happy to hear it. That leaves only the matter of a sponsor, which Jett is taking care of as we speak, and a coach.
We’ll obviously want to keep an eye out for anyone else with some talent… But for now, this is our roster.
The three of us share a long look at one another. Before any other thought can come to mind, Stunt ends the silence.
Wait a second. I'm going to live with a bunch of girls? This isn't one of those sponsor-bait teams, is it?
MACH! Did you trick me into signing on as a practice drone?! This was not part of the future protoss bonjwa's plan!
Uh, no. Does Jett strike you as the type of person to run a team like that? Also, I thought Reva was a guy.
Oh. Right.
What is the name of our team?
Oh. Uh. We haven’t picked one out yet.
That is troublesome. Should not such a thing been taken care of by now?
I really should have gotten around to asking Jett. Stunt shares in Reva’s indignation with a gesture towards her.
Thank you! We need to get this done already. How about we call ourselves the Lamenting Reapers?
The hell? What is it with this kid and terrible team names?
I’ll talk with Jett tonight, okay? All you guys need to do is practice and wait for the announcement. You also need to be prepared to move out.
It’s pretty short notice, but neither of them protest so it hopefully won’t be a problem. Stunt definitely lives with his mom... It’s harder to tell with Reva.
She seems to be about my age, maybe a bit younger. It’s possible she lives on her own.
Very well, as long as the matter is not being neglected. Was there more of importance to go over?
If not, I would prefer to return home. A PC bang is an improper practice environment.
Pft, you’re just a shut-in. Don’t deny it, it’s written all over you.
I am not. What right do you have—
But before she can say anything else, Stunt lurches forward, grabs Reva by the wrist, and begins dragging her towards the PCs.
If you’re going to live in our team house, you better get used to practicing next to other people.
Let me show you one of my favorite ‘unproductive’ builds.
Hours of games together serve the three of us well. Most professional gamers have a certain level of respect for someone that can put up strong matches, even if they don’t have great results. 
While Stunt and Reva have playstyles as wildly different as their personalities, both are formidable opponents.
Golden Zonefire’s peak time passed about an hour ago. While it’s not nearly as empty as it was when Reva arrived, there’s enough room that we have a relatively quiet section to ourselves.
Hey Reva, Accel told me that you know all three races. Why are you only playing terran?
Terran is the best choice given the current metagame. It is also the only race that earns one hundred percent of its wins.
Blunt, but I can’t deny her logic. Especially when she puts up such a strong match. She’s pretty biased when it comes to game balance, though.
I’ve got to say, Stunt’s unit control is ridiculously precise. It’s a shame he only puts it to use with his so-called innovative strategies.
Jett’s on her way with some good news, or so a text from her says. The only thing that’s keeping my mind off of her imminent arrival is the game between Stunt and Reva unfolding ahead of me.
Stunt’s going proxy two gate yet again. Reva scouted it four of the last five times he’s tried it. He’s just being stubborn at this point.
Still, the map is well-suited for the build, and he’s already managed to kill an SCV with some good probe micro.
Reva’s defense is formulaic as always. So far it’s working, but she’s in for a bit of a surprise after I sneak a glance at Stunt’s screen.
A half-dozen probes stream up Reva’s ramp and cut off an exit for the two marines kiting a pair of zealots.
The protoss units close the distance and slice the pair of marines to pieces, securing a massive advantage that Stunt carries into a victory.
Stunt pushes away from his monitor and stands, hands on his hips.
Easy!
Reva doesn’t let it faze her. She rotates in her chair and shrugs.
Unorthodox and inconsistent. But it worked, I will admit.
Stunt basks in the glory of victory for a moment longer before something behind me catches his attention.
I follow his gaze to find Jett and a man in a business suit walking towards us. He seems out of place dressed so well in a PC bang.
Mach and… Reva, right? This is Mr. Kim, VP of partnerships at Enoch Group. His company is looking to get into eSports.
The casual timbre of her voice and the pained look on her face says it all: Do not screw this up. I tighten up my posture and lower my head in a bow at the exec.
It’s nice to meet you, Mr. Kim. What does your company do?
... And realize too late that I probably shouldn't have admitted that I've never heard of Enoch.
Jett seethes through her teeth, but Mr. Kim takes my question with an easy smile and offers me his business card.
I give the card a brief once-over before placing it carefully in my pocket.
We’re in a handful of markets and offer a variety of business services. Consulting, marketing, and a few other things.
Oh. That sounds important.
And vague, though I don’t say that. Truth be told, I’m pretty much clueless when it comes to business related things.
Stunt and Reva’s deer-in-the-headlight silence isn’t exactly helping, either.
But it’s as Jett says. eSports is a fascinating industry with strong potential for continued growth. I'm particularly interested in strategic opportunities based on its unique qualities.
I’ve proposed the idea of sponsoring a fresh team to Enoch’s board, but for now we’re just shopping around.
He pauses to observe my reaction. I get a strong feeling that this guy is a pro at negotiation.
As if she suspects the very same thing, Jett steps forward to prevent me from saying anything that could take away her leverage.
As I said before, we’re still not ready to accept any offers. You have our interest, but we're keeping our options open for the time being.
Of course, there's no rush. I merely wanted the chance to introduce myself.
Mm. And we’ve got plenty to discuss. Thank you for the ride, Mr. Kim.
It was no trouble. We’ll be in touch.
And with that, the businessman departs just as quickly as he arrived. It’s only once he’s gone that I realize just how tense my shoulders are.
That guy looks like a secret agent or an insider. Can we name our team that? Secret Agentz?
Is this Stunt, Mach?
She thumbs in his direction and turns back to him when I nod.
Shut up, Stunt. We’re probably going to have to name our team after his company.
Man. I’ve been coming up with all kind of mascots and taglines... Team Enoch? That’s so lame.
With a sigh, Stunt sinks down in his chair. Jett does her best to ignore him.
So, these are the two you managed to pick up? Stunt and Reva. A cafe whelp and a ladder hero... and a literal 'who' foreigner.
The three of us don’t have anything to say to that, so she continues.
Alright, whatever. We’re going to make this work one way or another. All that’s left for us to do is recruit a coach.
Got anyone in mind?
Not particularly. VIP hasn’t exactly been great for networking outside of the team. They're pretty much done for as soon as I leave.
The ease with which she delivers that judgement leaves me taken aback.
I guess if she's going to sever ties with her old teammates, she can't afford to second guess herself. A brutal and unfortunate necessity.
How did you know Mr. Kim then?
We’ve only just met. I asked around if anyone knew of decent sponsorship opportunities, and an old Brood War friend pointed me in his direction.
Fortunate. A coach should be relatively easy to acquire with word that a sponsor is ready to back us.
Reva stares unblinking at no one in particular. It’s a little bit creepy just how calculating she looks.
Right. Anyway, I can handle the rest. You three just need to focus on practice, hear me?
Yup!
Yes.
Yeah.
Good. I’ll keep you posted on developments. If everything goes as planned, we’ll be registered and ready to rock by week’s end. The next VSTL starts two weekends after that.
The fire burning in Jett’s eyes is a refreshing sight. I can only promise so much to Stunt and Reva, but for them to see a proven player like Jett get behind the team has to be motivating.
I need to get back to the VIP team house. It’s about time I let them know that I’m not re-signing. Mach, give these two my number. Text me if you need something.
Before I can even respond, Jett is halfway to the door.
Rather than dwell on her words or sit in silence, Stunt bounds to his feet and clenches a fist forward.
You heard her, chumps! More practice!
I am afraid not. I must be getting home. Jett is not the only one with preparations to make.
Yeah, same. Don’t let us stop you, though.
Tch, fine. Let it be known that when I begged and pleaded for practice partners, I was cruelly denied by my own teammates.
Stunt’s theatrical complaints don’t end until I follow Reva out onto the street. Through the door’s window, he gives us a sour face and then returns to his PC.
He is a bit childish.
Well, he's still a kid.
The two of us start heading in the same direction by coincidence, though neither of us bring it up as we share simple conversation.
I ask about her build orders, and she asks me about foreign tournaments. Reva reacts with surprise when I inform her on the antics of foreign FPS pro-gamers.
Would shouting insults at each other mid-match not disrupt their ability to communicate?
No idea. All I know is that they get loud enough to hear from the open bracket area.
Curious.
Our small talk is cut short when she heads for a subway tunnel located along my route home.
But just before she descends the tile steps, Reva turns and offers a rare smile.
Goodbye, Mach. It was nice to meet you.
Bye. Catch you online.
When she’s gone, I’m left to think over the day’s events alone. Mr. Kim, Enoch... This is all too good to be true.
It feels right to be wary. Too many aspiring pro-gamers have had their fledgling careers dashed to pieces by stupid mistakes and broken promises. I can’t let myself be one of them.
Maybe I’ve earned the chance to rest, to congratulate myself.
But I won’t. Not yet.
Lately, the streets haven’t seemed so foreign or confusing.
It might just be because I stick to the same route every time I walk to Golden Zonefire, but I like to think I’ve really started to figure out life as a foreigner.
I’ve settled into a routine that works for me. A few hours of ladder in the morning, then I hang out at the cafe with whoever shows up that day.
Practice, talk strategy, maybe grab some food, and then we go our separate ways.
It’s enough to satisfy me, while still offering plenty of free time to keep from burning out. It’s not a champion’s regimen, but it should suffice. Hopefully.
Jett is always pushing me to practice longer, but it's hard to see the point. What's ten hours going to do for me that six hours doesn't?
I haven’t seen that Bolt guy at Golden Zonefire since I challenged him, luckily. I was anxious about the possibility of running into him again.
A confrontation when I’m supposed to be training is the last thing I need.
Familiar landmarks crop up one by one. It’s not long before the cafe comes into view, busy as it always is on the weekends.
I squeeze past a half dozen middle schoolers and make my way to our quiet corner.
Yo! What took ya? We’ve been waiting on you for sooooooo long.
Don’t listen to him. He got here just before you did.
Stunt scowls and sinks down in his chair. I try not to smile.
Reva’s a no-show again. Messaged me this morning that she wanted to stay in and ladder. Is Accel coming? I know Crash has team league tonight.
Nope. He mentioned that he has some last minute build prep to take care of. Who are they playing again?
KaiNE, I think.
Right.
There are a lot of advantages for players on a team. Recognition, housing, practice, salary—but getting to play in team league is one of the biggest perks, period.
A lot of young StarCraft talent breaks out in VSTL. Matches against top players are usually rare for those that aren't qualified for VSL, but not in team league.
For an amateur, a win there is more than a sign of good things to come.
Did Accel tell you anything about his team’s plan?
Jett shakes her head before successfully snatching Stunt’s phone out of his hand. She rolls it in the space between her fingers and turns back to me.
Don’t be so naive, Mach. Accel and I may be friends, but that sort of information isn’t something you can give away freely.
Stunt gropes for his phone, a pout set across his face. Jett dodges a few times before willingly relinquishing the device.
Stop ignoring us. It’s rude.
Tch, whatever. You quit lecturing Mach.
Their eyes battle briefly before Jett concedes, glancing away with a dismissive gesture. Stunt savors his fleeting victory with a grin before dropping the phone to the table.
It's rare to find someone willing to share their strategies openly. Maybe it’s different in the foreign scene, but not here.
I lost to an amazing one base all-in build on ladder a week back. Sent the guy a message asking for a few replays. He told me to kill myself.
You don't need to look so pleased about it. Sheesh.
However, there's one exception.
That being?
If a foreigner eliminates a Korean player, our scene will sometimes band together and send replays for his next opponent to study.
It's a matter of national pride at that point. Been that way since Brood War.
That's a rumor I've heard before. Replays can be invaluable in preparing for a specific player. What could be more useful than an exact recording of someone's strategies and tactics?
At least Jett has the courtesy to look vaguely apologetic. I nod, doing my best not to look too surprised.
How much do Korean players practice for team league? The same as the individual leagues or...?
Depends. Not less, if they aren't taking home at least top eight in solo league. StarCraft may be a one on one game, but teams can't always be sponsored on the backs of individuals.
Don’t think that gives you the right to neglect your solo league. Admittedly, VSTL is secondary to VSL. If any of you fail to qualify, I’ll make you a slave of my practice house.
Cool your jets, Jett, and have a little confidence in us.
When you inspire confidence, I will. Remind me again how you placed in the last qualifier?
Stunt wrinkles his nose and takes the opportunity to return to his cell phone game. Even between teammates, StarCraft’s competitive nature thrives.
Silence lingers until I decide to speak up, if only to break the tension.
Why don’t we go watch Accel play tonight? I’m sure he’ll appreciate the support.
They simultaneously glance up at me, and then at each other. More silence.
I’m just about ready to give up when Jett speaks.
That's a good idea. I've been meaning to speak with Accel anyway.
Sounds like fun. Let’s bet on the games, though.
Gambling? I shouldn't be surprised. You play protoss, after all.
Twenty-five thousand on Crash.
Hah! I’ll take that bet any day.
Wait, I’m not done. Twenty-five thousand won on Crash. But if Accel all-kills, you pay double.
Stunt pauses, chewing over the odds with a contorted look on his face. All-kills are incredibly rare. It’s hard enough for one player to single-handedly defeat more than one opponent, let alone an entire team.
With his decision made, Stunt slams a fist down hard enough to draw a few glances from a nearby table.
Deal. The match won’t be for another few hours, so you’ll have plenty of time to regret your mistake while I’m kicking your ass.
I wanna try out this new build making the rounds called the two-base immortal all-in. It crushes zerg, or they're saying on the forums.
Let’s go. Hey Mach, come watch and learn a thing or two about how to PvZ like a pro.
That's useless to me. And I need to message Reva anyway. She’s gotta come—
He doesn’t wait for me to finish my thought before bolting for an open PC. I’m left with Jett, who takes her time in joining Stunt.
He’s funny.
Funny doesn’t win games.
Jett seems conspicuously pensive as she rises to head over to a machine. Just as she turns to leave, she stops and looks back at me.
Mach. Do you think that teammates have to be friends?
Eh? What do you mean?
The question is straightforward. Yes or no, do teammates need to be friends?
What? Of course they should. Why wouldn’t you be friends with the people you live and practice with?
It’s not that simple. What are you supposed to do if your teammate can’t perform and needs to be replaced?
What if your friendship keeps you from offering honest criticism, the type that hurts to hear?
Nobody is expected to be friends with their coworkers at an office job. You act cordial and work together to get something done. That’s it. There’s no reason that eSports should be any different.
It’s not the same. Can you honestly say that you’d be as motivated to turn around a losing set for a bunch of strangers than for your friends?
... Hmph. You’re not being realistic.
Err. Teammates should be civil, but it isn’t necessary that they be friends.
I agree. The goals of a friendship and the goals of a team don’t always align. It can complicate things and make life more difficult for everyone.
If only more people saw it that way. eSports isn't a game for people afraid to face the real world.
Too many losers retreat to StarCraft and expect everything outside of the game to be easy and fun. People like that aren't cut out for eSports. Or anything, really.
In any case, you did well to recruit Stunt and Reva. I appreciate it.
I’ll take care of the rest. Be around Golden Zonefire every single day for the next week or so. And practice. Practice a lot.
She answers my nod by taking off in Stunt's direction.
Where is she? After all it took to convince her, Reva better not have changed her mind without telling me. Maybe she's the type to always be running late.
This is the first time I've been back at the VSL studio since the qualifier. Reva's not the only one who feels out of place.
I'm just about to send her another text when I catch the top of her head coming up the stairs.
Get lost in the subway again?
My apologies. This is my first time at the VSL studio.
Oh. Really? You've never tried to qualify or come to spectate?
She shakes her head. That's a huge surprise, considering she's local.
It's easy enough to follow the VSL online, but nothing beats the live experience. Watching the round of four in person was one of the first things I did here in Seoul.
Jett and Stunt are probably waiting for us. C'mon.
Nearly every seat in the spectator area of the VSL studio is taken. It’s only with a wave from Jett that Reva and I are ushered past the back rows and into our seats over on the side.
Stunt is seated beside Jett and acknowledges us with a smile. With how differently the four of us are dressed, it’d be hard for anyone to tell that we’re actually a team.
Well, I guess technically we’re not a team yet. Not officially, anyway. With the thought on my mind, I look to Jett and keep my voice low.
Do we have a uniform planned?
Oh, hell yeah! I want a team jacket.
The uniform we pick comes out of the team's warchest. It’s stupid for us to splurge when we don't have any results.
Stunt’s longing stare doesn’t fade away until Jett focuses a glare in his direction.
The production crew is busy at work behind the scenes. There are way more VSL staff members than the stream lets on.
People with clipboards and headsets pace the studio frantically, moving from team benches to behind the booths and then back again.
Accel sits on the end of the bench with the rest of Crash. Their coach, a balding man with small eyes, a red nose, and a clip on tie, paces back and forth with his hands in the pockets of his blazer.
Most coaches are usually retired players or have management experience. This guy has got either the latter or nothing—it wouldn’t surprise me to learn that he’s never played a game of StarCraft in his life.
The players of Team KaiNE sit on the opposite side of the studio. Their coach is far more subdued and one that I actually recognize: An old B-tier Brood War pro that aged out of his ability to compete.
Stunt leans over Jett to whisper something,
 but before he can open his mouth, the Victory StarLeague's theme song cuts in to announce that the broadcast is about to get started.
Korean StarLeagues have a weird fascination with alt rock. The same songs from my embarrassing freshman year playlist blast unabashedly to stadiums of eSports fans.
The crowd’s cheers die down only once the commentators give their introductions. When I look over my shoulder, I can see the table where they keep the two English casters.
The duo is loved more for their laidback banter than their game analysis, not that it's anything I'd change.
There’s no way for me to hear them without getting a headpiece that'll make me look like a tourist. I'll have to settle for the Korean commentators.
Welcome to the VSTL! Today's first match is an exciting duel between Crash and KaiNE.
Ah, both are very solid teams that have been around from the very beginning of StarCraft 2. I am eager to see whether or not they show us good games.
This is the furthest that KaiNE has been since the beginning of the StarCraft 2 team league. Crash will need to make it to VSTL finals if they wish to share that accomplishment!
Indeed! They have a challenging path ahead of them, but I am certain that they are capable of returning to their former glory.
My thoughts are the same. Only one of KaiNE's players remains in the VSL, so they should have had plenty of time to practice for this match. Can the same be said for Crash?
Certainly so. Crash's lineup is well-tested and proven in the VSL. It's a sure bet that they have not neglected to prepare accordingly.
... Well. There won't be any jokes about cartoons from the 90s, but I should stay pretty well informed throughout the series.
An array of multicolored overhead lights announce the first match. Polished motion graphics and meticulously collected player statistics whiz around the display at the front of the studio.
The VSL studio really has hype-building down to a science.
Who do you think Crash is going to send out first, Jett?
Not Accel, unless they want him getting sniped right off the bat.
I nod. A common strategy in team league is to have a mid-tier player spend all of his practice time preparing specifically for one heavy hitter.
There are other things to take into account too, like the map or remaining opponents. But there’s no doubt that Team KaiNE has one of their players ready to take down Accel.
By the time I glance back up at the stage, the first two players are headed into the booths. Accel remains on the bench, eyes set on the same screen as the crowd.
It is starting.
Sure enough, once the players have their settings prepared and the coaches give the go-ahead, the match begins.
Luckily, Stunt has the sense not to gloat about the money that he just won from Jett.
The four of us sit in silence as we watch Accel agonize over his loss. 
While KaiNE is huddled together with smiles and cheers, all of Crash sit with their heads down save Accel, who still hasn’t left the booth.
His coach looks furious. He barges in through the booth’s back door and raves at Accel from behind his back.
I can’t believe what I’m seeing. Frustration is one thing, but Accel won two games before he went out.
Even if he had gone down without a win, there’s no reason to yell at him. How is that supposed to help?
Just as my anger on Accel’s behalf reaches the point that I think to say something to Jett, Accel rises from his seat and slides past his coach without so much as a glance in his direction.
Should we go talk to him?
Yeah. C’mon.
The three Korean commentators are in the middle of winding down the series with post-match analysis when we rise and exit through the studio’s backdoor.
We find Accel standing alone with a palm on his forehead. When he catches our footsteps, Accel turns to regard us all with his typical grin.
I lost. Oh well.
His carefree attitude is unique among professional gamers. If the average pro isn't angry or depressed by a loss, they’re at least frustrated.
Part of me wonders whether or not Accel is covering up his true feelings, but he seems genuinely fine.
Bad luck, Accel. You played well.
Yeah. Thanks.
What’s the deal with your coach? He seemed really upset with you.
Accel scoffs, allowing the disgust in his voice to show on his face.
He’s useless, especially considering that I do his job for team league. Busted my ass preparing for tonight—picked out the builds and the snipers and everything. Drilled the team for more than a week.
And your coach has laid the blame for the loss at your feet.
Accel nods and glances away. Spectators begin filtering out of the studio, offering us curious looks as they head outside. Looks like the studio is done for the night.
It’s ridiculous. And not a single person on Crash had the guts to back me up. I didn’t switch from Brood War to suffer spineless teammates and a coach with an ongoing mid-life crisis.
And you shouldn’t have to. Accel, ditch Crash and come coach for us.
Four pairs of eyes land on Jett, all but Reva’s bewildered. Accel recovers quickly before crossing his arms.
You know I can’t. I have a contract. It’s not up until next year.
A player contract, one that bars you from playing in StarLeagues for any team but Crash.
Even so, I can’t break the terms. I'm required to play for them. They can take legal action against me if I don't.
And you will, if they insist on it. Live, train, and coach at our team house. All you have to do is show up once a week to play your matches at the studio, and Crash can’t do anything.
Reva pushes her glasses up against the bridge of her nose, pensive. Stunt stares wide-eyed, as if a pivotal scene in a drama is playing out. As for me…
We could really use you, Accel. You deserve better.
... If I do this and the team doesn’t work out, my career is over.
He says it as much to himself as he does the rest of us. It’s true, and probably true for everyone else as well.
Accel stares at the floor for a while, deep in thought. When he finally looks up, it’s with a casual shrug.
Screw it. I’ve put off my mandatory military training for too long anyway. I’m down.
Stunt lets loose an ear-shattering cheer and flings his arms into the air. Reva's glasses nearly fall off in surprise, though she manages to catch them by the frame.
HELL YEAH! TEAM ENOCH NUMBAH ONE!!!
What a motley crew. A cafe whelp, a ladder hero, a no-name foreigner, and now some laidback hyung.
You forgot the washed-up champ.
Try as she might, Jett can’t hide the satisfied grin showing on her face. Everything has really come together.
This is it. This is what I came to Korea for. The months of endless ladder, the late-night online tournaments. I’m on a team. A real team.
We need to celebrate.
Oh, you want to treat the team? How kind of you, Mach.
Jett glances around to see if her quip earned a laugh, only to find Accel wagging a finger at her.
Have you already forgotten who convinced you to take the risk and form your own team? I’d say that’s worth a bottle of soju or two. Or ten.
Tch.
Jett brings a finger to her lip, either considering which bar to take us to or how to get out of paying.
Alright, enjoy the hell out of tonight. It’ll be the last time until we’ve got a championship trophy that we celebrate anything. Got that?
Good choice.
HELL YEAH!
Understood.
With a nod from Jett, the five of us walk shoulder to shoulder in high spirits. But just as we’re about to descend the stairs, Jett pauses.
Wait. Accel. Do you need to go talk to your team or anything?
That stops the rest of us in our tracks. We turn and find Accel at complete ease.
Nah. I'll take care of it later.
With a knowing smile, he leads us down the stairs and out onto the street.
The bar that Jett had in mind was halfway across the city, though after a subway ride it doesn’t take us more than thirty minutes to arrive. 
The trendy-looking lounge is packed with twentysomethings, most of them older than even Accel.
Stunt walks ahead of us with a swagger, noting with pride on the way over to our table that he has a fake-id and goes to bars all the time.
With who, your mom?
With your mom, bitch!
My mom is in the U.S. though.
Oh, her flight landed already?
I can’t help but laugh. Stunt is incredibly immature, even for his age. But there’s something undeniably uplifting about his enthusiasm.
With all of the booths full, we pick out a table close to an empty dance floor. It’s cramped with the five of us, but we make do.
Man, I can’t remember the last time I went out like this. Spent so much of this year cooped up in the Crash team house.
Mm. Same. VIP’s mandatory hours were brutal by Star2 standards. No one even made good use of them.
A scruffy waiter dressed no differently than the bar’s patrons stops by to take our drink orders before Stunt can return to bragging about his iron stomach.
Jett shows three fingers for the number of soju bottles she wants. With a click of his tongue, the waiter departs with our order in hand.
There’s five of us though, Jett.
You think I can’t count? You don’t drink soju from the bottle.
Oh. Well, I’ve never had it before.
That is not a surprise. Soju is unpopular outside of Korea.
We’ll show you how to do it right, Mach.
While awaiting the server's return, I notice Accel glancing repeatedly in Reva's direction.
Mach, what ended up happening with Reva? And who's our friend here?
.........
I am Reva! And, allow me to say that it is a great pleasure to meet you in person!
 Your play has been.....
 an inspiration......... to..... m...e...
Uh. Is Reva an Accel fangirl? She'd have been maybe fifteen at the prime of his Brood War career...
Well. A shame that these punks didn't have the decency to introduce us properly. It's nice to finally meet you, Reva.
No lie, your mech is the best I've seen outside of VSL. You've got to show me the timings on your double armory build at some point.
Y-You too.
I think he broke her. It's okay Reva, I've been there.
Reva manages to (mostly) pull herself out of her fangirl shock by the time our waiter returns.
When he's gone, Accel pours out a shot-glass worth of soju and hands it to me.
Go on. In one gulp.
There isn’t much liquid in the glass, so I throw it back without a second thought. It takes a few seconds for my tastebuds to react.
Ugh, this stuff is awful. It’s all I can do not to retch.
It’s... good...
How does a girl learn Korean without coming across soju at least once? It's kind of impressive, actually.
I learned online. Wasn't ever a part of my lessons, I guess.
That is one of the most difficult ways to learn a language. How did you manage?
K-pop and StarCraft. They didn’t offer Korean as a language option at my high school, so I studied it in my spare time.
K-pop? Disgusting. I knew you were Koreaboo scum.
At least I did something useful with my dumb hobbies. Can you say the same? How's your English?
...
<H-Hello! I am Stunt! Protoss! I am one!>
<Very bad. Used two names to help, and said lies. Bad student and player needs to work harder.>
Reva asks for my approval with a look. I give it with a nod.
Bad what? What'd she say, Mach?
Bad luck. You were almost perfect.
Hah! Knew it, I'm a natural.
I pour out a shot for Accel, relieved when the culture test is over. Jett's three bottles are soon emptied and then replaced.
The soju-fueled conversations range from StarCraft and team houses to fashion and college, and whatever else in between.
You three are so lucky. Korean guys drop two of our golden years on the military! It’s totally unfair! Tell 'em, Accel!
Stunt points at Jett, me, and then Reva. Neither of them seem particularly ruffled.
Accel only watches, slightly drunk and highly entertained.
I would gladly spend two years in our military to reap the benefits of your gender.
Seriously. Do you have any idea how uncomfortable being pressured into some braindead photoshoot with a pink keyboard is?
'Smile agasshi! Headphones don't sell themselves you know! Why don't you lose the team jacket and pull down your shirt a bit? Oh, I want to see you with double eyelids by next time!'
It's just like that. Literally the worst.
... Dear god. Jett, please, never do that again.
Sponsors pay you to sit in front of a camera. How terrible!
Don’t tell me that there aren’t advantages for girls in eSports! It’s SO much easier to get on a team, and you get way more fans!
You cannot understand without experiencing it firsthand, so you only see the good.
Come on, Mach! Back me up here.
... Uh, what could possibly have made you think I'd be on your side in this argument?
You three are so dramatic! What could possibly be worth trading away the free popularity?
When I was an amateur back in Brood War, some gross KPGA pen-pusher said he’d help me get my pro license if I spent the night at his place. I had just turned 17.
All of our eyes shift to Jett, surprised—though Stunt’s most of all. I take a moment to silently appreciate that StarCraft 2 doesn’t require a pro license to play in StarLeagues.
... Did you do it?
NO! What the hell is wrong with you!?
Jett snatches her glass off the table and snaps her arm back. When Stunt recoils and shrinks beneath the table, she returns her drink to her lips with a scowl.
Is it a crime to wonder?!
Jett grinds her teeth back and forth with her eyes on Stunt, only turning away when she notices Reva and I watching her.
For the record, I reported him and he was fired. Push back or be pushed around.
Accel drops his fist to the table with thump, ending the argument and earning our attention.
We are going to play a drinking game.
Why?
Why? Because we’re about to condemn ourselves to lives of timing attacks, hard contains, and positional play.
We’ve got one night to get hammered and we’re going to make the most of it.
You’ve convinced me. What do you want to play?
Oh! Let’s play the King’s Game!
Shut up. The King’s Game is for desperate teenagers.
She glances over Stunt and offers a smile to make her point.
Nah, nah. Chopsticks. It’s really simple. I say something that might describe one of us more than the others, and we point at who we think what’s said describes best.
Eh. I don’t follow.
Okay, it’s like this: Which of us is most likely to hate soju?
Accel takes a chopstick from the table and points it at me, as do Jett, Reva, and Stunt.
And then you drink. But we won’t count that one.
Oh. That makes sense.
Mhm. Why don’t you start us off with a few?
Which of us is most likely to end up a NEET?
Four sets of chopsticks immediately fall onto Reva. One of her sticks slips out from between her fingers and onto the floor.
M-Me?
C’mon, you give off a powerful shut-in vibe.
I do not understand.
You’re doing it right now! It’s like you learned how to communicate from a text-to-speech program.
Reva, what do you like besides games and eSports? Do you have any hobbies?
... I watch anime.
... Anything else?
.............
See.
Jett is doing her best to keep from piling on, but the urge is evident on her face.
But I have StarCraft, so I cannot be a NEET. That should be considered employment.
Sure, but the question was who was most likely. If you washed out of professional gaming, I could totally see you as an MMO addict.
I have max level characters in the most popular three, but that does not qualify me as an addict on its own.
God. How? Those games are disgustingly grindy. You really aren’t helping your case.
Okay, answer this: What StarCraft community site do you read and post on the most?
It is an imageboard.
Drink, Reva.
Which of us is most likely still a virgin?
Before he can even react, Accel, Jett, and I point our chopsticks in Stunt’s direction. He jumps in his seat, aghast.
He senses weakness in Reva and aims his answer towards her, only to have her repay the favor.
THIS IS BULLSHIT!
Calm down. You’re like, what. Twelve?
You guys have NO idea! I’m a playa, you hear me?
Doubtful.
You were hanging out with middle schoolers at a PC bang when I found you. Be honest with us.
Stunt scrunches up his face, allowing his rage to stew momentarily before bursting out with another protest.
This is a rigged question. You guys all have like, at least four years of extra time to luck out.
Virginity confirmed. Drink.
Oh, cut the kid some slack. It’d be kinda weird if he wasn’t.
A breach of trust! Ethically unsound! Harassment on an unreasonable scale!
He makes a box on the table with his finger, continuing his exaggerated and antiquated protests all the while.
This is a no bullying area. If you enter the DMZ, I will retaliate with full force.
Which of us has the worst fans?
Pft, it’s not like anyone but Accel and I even—
Jett’s train of thought shatters when she notices four chopsticks pointed in her direction.
What!?
Defiantly, Jett aims her own at Accel. He merely grins in response.
Be honest. When was the last time you had a meet and greet session where some fanboy didn’t slobber all over you?
Your brusque attitude attracts a certain type of fan, Jett.
What’s that supposed to mean?
It means they like it when you call someone trash! C’mon, you’re the one that gives those blunt pre-game interviews.
I simply say what’s on my mind. If that happens to be how confident I am, then so what? And what does that have to do with my fans?
Let’s put it like this. Reva, what would you say to the crowd before a big finals match?
I would like to thank my fans for cheering for me. I have worked hard to improve my condition and will send my opponent to Andromeda. I promise to show you good games.
So you'll get earnest supporters that love to see you do well.
But Jett, your fans want you to lose almost as much as they want you to win.
That’s absurd. People that cheer for my losses aren’t my fans.
Whatever you want to call them, they’re yours and yours alone. Don't pretend like you don't know what we're talking about.
I have plenty of very nice and well-intentioned fans. You’re just focusing on the minority of terrible ones.
Oh, like the guy who brought a bodypillow with your picture to an autograph session? How could I forget!
Jett’s expression flashes a mixture of anger and embarrassment. She looks ready to throw a punch.
GOD DAMMIT ACCEL, I TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT IN CONFIDENCE.
IF ANY OF YOU EVER BRING THIS UP AGAIN, YOU DIE.
..................
... There's no way I'm asking. I'm smarter than that.
Jett seethes in displeasure at Accel. He's trying hard to keep from cracking up.
... Did you sign it?
Without consciously realizing it, I find myself dodging something.
Jett's shotglass whizzes past my head and shatters on the wall behind me. From across the room, a few of the bar’s patrons laugh drunkenly at the absurdity.
She reaches for another, apparently intent on making sure she gets her point across. I’m left with no choice but to raise my hands and surrender.
I don’t need to know! I don’t need to know!
She sets the glass down and looks away from the rest of us, still hot-faced from the negative attention.
Which of us is the most likely to bang a fan?
Rushing right out the gate, are we? You’re supposed to do a few more warm up questions before you to get to the raunchy stuff.
You say that only because you know you’re going to lose this one.
Despite finding himself staring down four pairs of chopsticks, Accel never loses his easygoing smile.
I freely admit I’ve slept with one of my fans before. This question is more like winning than losing anyway since I'm not a lech.
Do you have a story to go along with it?
Pretty much what you’d expect. This one girl used to show up to all my Brood War matches. She cheered for me, brought gifts, and led the fanchants. Managed my fanclub too.
I was knocked out of a StarLeague pretty early a few years back. She was the only person that showed up to my meet and greet afterwards.
I asked her if she’d like to go to dinner, and she said yes. It went from there. We dated for more than a year. Had to break it off when she went abroad for university.
Ah, now you’ve got me feeling nostalgic. Thanks, Mach.
What a beautiful story.
It’s hard to tell if the complete lack of emotion in Reva’s voice is intentional.
I know those kind of fans. They’re always like, ‘oh, when I imagine him practicing all day, my heart aches and I want to make him hot soups!’
Literally no one has said or ever will say that.
They’re gonna be saying it when I take my place as the protoss bonjwa. Can't wait to have my legion of loyal fangirls called Stunt's C—
A well-timed hiccup stops Stunt in his tracks. He laughs obnoxiously when his head hits the table.
Someone should really confiscate this kid's fake.
We finish out our game of chopsticks with a slew of highly inappropriate questions and equally bold answers.
I like soju way more in my stomach than on my lips. Though, I’m not sure I’ll feel the same way in the morning.
Our celebration goes late into the night, long enough that we’re practically the only patrons left. 
A tendril of drool collects at the corner of an unconscious Stunt's lip. Reva’s eyes are unfocused behind her glasses.
But while there’s a bit extra to Accel’s typical grin, both he and Jett look as collected as ever.
... It’s late.
Accel pulls the phone out of Stunt's pocket and checks the time.
Oh. It is.
He then replaces the expensive-looking electronic on the young protoss player’s head.
Jett, the next time you travel for a European tournament, make sure you show up to the afterparty.
Say what you will about their play, but those guys know how to have a good time.
Pass. I go for easy prize money, not discotec with Lars and Jørgen.
You guys ready to leave?
Yeah. Should, if we don’t want to wake up after noon.
This is the worst part of every night out. How the hell are we supposed to get Stunt home?
Don’t forget Jett, the bill is all yours.
Aaaaaaaaaaaah... Why’d you remind me?
I can hail a cab for Stunt, I guess.
That sounds-- 
Wait, no. Accel, you're in charge of getting Stunt home.
Am I?
You are. Got team business with these two.
Jett thumbs over her shoulder at me and Reva. The two of us share a look, while Accel accepts the order with an easy smile.
On it, then. Wake up kid.
.................................................................................................. Huhwhat?
Stunt stares through Accel, unresponsive to his offered hand. So much for his iron stomach.
Rather than wait out Stunt's stupor, Accel takes the young protoss under his arm and simply carries him out the front door, oblivious to the stares that follow.
Now then. Let's talk.
Are we in trouble?
What? No. What would make you think that?
I don't know. I'm getting a parent-teacher conference vibe.
God, will you just let me... Look, I'm trying to acknowledge the fact that it's unusual for three girls to be on the same team.
How is that relevant?
Yeah, I'm with Reva. If we're not playing in female-only leagues, does it really matter?
Will you two just shut up and listen? It's not going to change how I run things, but I wanted to at least pass along some things I've learned.
Your job is to train hard and win at StarCraft. Nothing else. The only person you have to represent is yourself.
Don't let anyone guilt you into being an activist. I mean, if it's what you want to do, then go for it. But you have no obligation to pick up a megaphone because you succeeded.
That seems somewhat selfish.
Yeah, well, when you win a VSL and find out that people care more about your gender than your play, let me know if you change your mind.
I get where Jett's coming from, especially considering her history. But I don't think that's all there is to it.
Regardless, my main focus is and always will be on winning games.
Reva doesn't elaborate any further, even with a probing stare from Jett. I'm left to fill her silence.
Um. I'm just here to play video games.
Win at video games. Not play.
Our waiter glides by the table and slips the check in front of Jett, spoiling her grin instantly.
When she's done begrudgingly signing her actual name at the bottom, the three of us head out of the bar and share a cab home.
I wake to the taste of stale soju on my breath. My apartment is mostly dark, save the crack of light coming through my window.
It takes a great deal of effort to dredge myself out of bed, but the need to rinse my mouth is enough motivation.
The first time I ever drank too much, I swore to myself I’d never touch alcohol again.
Even if that was a pledge I knew that I wouldn’t keep, it seems like I won’t get another chance to for a while now.
Well, at least until there’s a trophy in our team house.
I return from the sink with a glass of water and fall into my computer chair. It’s too early for ladder, but I might see what's going on——
Wait a second. WHAT?
Oh my god. Accel, what did you do?
Every StarCraft fansite is abuzz with the news that Jett and Accel are ditching their teams. Accusations of collusion, conspiracy, and corruption abound among Korean and Western fans alike.
A laundry list of the Crash coach's missteps ranks second to an interview where he shifts the blame onto Accel. With the scent of drama in the air, debate rages wildly on both sides.
When Accel said he had a better idea in mind, I had no idea he meant something like this. Jett’s new team is the talk of the entire StarCraft community.
I rush into the game client, abusing the login button with a dozen clicks a second until I'm finally in. Accel is online, as is the rest of our team.
Before I can even open a chat window, an invite from Jett throws me into an underway group conversation.
Text messages appear almost as quickly as I can read them.
what the hell is wrong with you!?
heyhey relax. you know what they say about publicity
LOOOOOOL HOLY SHIT DUDE THIS IS HILARIOUS ROFL
Word that Stunt, Mach and I are joining is out. I’ve received multiple requests for interviews.
you should do it
you don’t understand! the deal with enoch wasn’t official, this is going to screw us!
heyhey. I didn’t mention enoch by name. just finish the deal and we’ll be fine
yeah, what’s stopping kim from signing us? accel is kind of right. we have buzz going now.
KEKEKEKEKEKEKEKEK
they're saying i poached you! couldn’t you have gotten back at your coach some other way???
nop. and I’ll get back at him more when I stomp Crash in team league
It would be prudent to speak with Mr. Kim as soon as possible, Jett.
I KNOW. UGH. ok, we’re meeting at namdan asap, the park by the VSL studio. everyone. no exceptions.
KK LOLL
The diamond next to Jett’s portrait changes from green to black. Accel quickly follows suit and then Stunt, leaving me in the chatroom alone with Reva.
be fast, jett’ll blow up your phone with texts otherwise.
I will. Goodbye.
With nothing else keeping me at home, I hurry to shut off my PC and dress. I take the stairs of my apartment building two at a time and make my way onto the street.
What a mess. How terrible would it be to have spent all of last night celebrating for nothing?
Truth be told, whether Accel leaked the information now or let it come out on its own, we’d eventually get this reaction.
Enoch wouldn’t have signed us without doing proper background research anyway. Maybe it's alright for this to be out in the open ahead of time.
I set those thoughts aside when Namdan Park comes into view. The crowded treeline and trimmed green is a welcome departure from Seoul’s endless concrete.
Jett didn’t specify where at the park she wanted us to meet, but it doesn’t take long before I find her staring down a seated Accel.
She’s in the middle of chewing him out, though it'd be hard to tell by the grin he’s wearing.
Have you seen what they’re saying online?!
The team has to stand out somehow. Better this than limping into scene and wallowing in obscurity.
We should stand out by winning games, not by stirring up shit. This wasn't your decision to make.
Accel’s the first to notice my arrival and waves me over. Jett’s acknowledgement follows, though it’s far less welcoming.
Did you know he was going to pull something like this?
What? No.
Relax, Jett. Seriously. Worrying will give you grey hairs.
I’ll relax the moment that I’m staring at a contract for six months of funding.
Jett’s stance goes rigid at the buzz of her phone. She rips it out of her pocket and stares at the screen.
Who is it?
Kim. He wants us to meet at the Enoch office to sort out this mess.
That’s a good thing, right? He wouldn’t bother to have us come out if the answer is going to be no.
She doesn’t seem to agree given the time it takes her to reply. I share a glance with Accel before Jett shoves the phone back into her pocket and turns to me.
We need to get moving. Accel, wait here for Stunt and Reva.
Fine by me.
Accel takes in a deep breath and returns to his bench, no doubt happy to relax while someone else handles the stress of a meeting.
I’m coming with you?
I’m not enough of a jerk to leave Stunt and Reva alone at the park for an hour, but I need someone at my back.
When you put it that way, alright.
Then come on. It’s not that far.
Without a moment to spare, Jett storms off.
Accel offers me a leisurely wave as I hurry after her.
Retry?
Quit
Retry
Yes
No
Most likely to end up a NEET
Most likely to have the worst fans
Most likely to bang a fan
Most likely to be a virgin
Indulge my curiosity
Value my safety
Let me do most of the talking, but chime in if it makes sense.
Alright.
Nervous?
No.
Don't lie to me. I’m nervous. It's fine to be nervous.
I’m fine.
When elevator door opens, a well-dressed Enoch employee greets us with a smile and gestures down the hall.
Mr. Kim has been anticipating your arrival. This way, please.
I follow Jett through a typical corporate office. Inside, a table seats Mr. Kim, his attention set on a laptop.
He glances past the screen to acknowledge us with a beckon forward.
Jett, Mach. Please, sit.
We take our seats opposite him. The secretary closes the board room’s door, leaving the three of us on our own.
After a few more taps on his laptop’s touchscreen, Mr. Kim turns the computer towards us and gestures sharply to it.
What is this?
On display is the comment section of a popular Korean eSports news site. Line after line portrays Jett and Accel as shady and unskilled.
... And I thought that the English sites were bad. Before I can read another comment, Mr. Kim forces the laptop shut with a grimace.
When I spoke of my interest to sponsor your team with the board, most were hesitant to take the risk even with my assurance that the investment would be worth it in the end.
Given the recent developments, I'll simply have to retract my recommendation and take the hit to my reputation. Your team has become a liability without having played a single game.
He rests a finger on his brow, expression fraught. This is worse than Jett and I planned for.
Do you have anything to say?
This wasn’t the reaction that we were hoping for. But it shows that people are paying attention to us.
Not all attention is created equal. What is most important is that an Enoch team has a large number of supporters. Not slack-jawed or passive observers. Fans that are invested in the team's victory.
You’ll immediately have five people invested in an Enoch squad if you sign us.
Through narrowed eyes, Mr. Kim shifts his eyes in my direction.
Mach. I should say that you are a large part of the doubt plaguing a possible sponsorship deal.
I blink once, taken aback. Me?
Are you truly surprised? Your ability is completely unproven. While Accel and Jett may have their integrity questioned, it’s you whom the fans mock.
If our fanbase doesn't have faith in your ability to win games, then of what use are you?
What?! I’m a good player! I just need time to prove it.
Time that you haven’t earned.
I hear myself tripping over my next protest. Right then, Jett cuts in.
Mr. Kim, there must be something that we can do. Accel and I are high profile. Even with a rocky start, we both have loyal fans that will follow us to a new team.
That may be so, but the public perception of Mach remains an issue. Is it worth the trouble of keeping her on when your reputation has been compromised?
He links his fingers together and glances between the two of us, awaiting an answer.
Jett closes her eyes and runs a hand through her hair. She takes a long moment to decide on what to say next, much to Mr. Kim's interest.
We could arrange something to fix that.
Oh? Elaborate.
A showmatch. The perfect chance to showcase Mach’s ability to compete.
Against someone from your team? Fans will assume that the match is fixed on her behalf.
No. I have someone else in mind. Someone who StarCraft fans know and respect, and that Mach owes a beating.
She turns towards and locks eyes with me. Is she talking about…?
A showmatch with Bolt? I mean…
You’re not allowed to turn this down.
I wasn’t planning on it. Just, how are you going to get him to agree?
I know Bolt well. He’ll jump at the chance to publicly humiliate someone he doesn’t like.
A best of five will do nicely. And I think it would be fair for Enoch to put half a month’s worth of team funding in as the prize, wouldn’t you say?
Jett turns away from me and towards Mr. Kim. For the first time since we stepped in the room, the businessman cracks a smile.
If you ever decide to leave StarCraft behind, you're welcome to interview for any open sales positions at Enoch, Jett.
Very well. If Mach is victorious in this showmatch, I will consider your team’s reputation redeemed.
I don’t bother asking what will happen if I lose. God, what did I do to deserve this pressure?
Would you mind speaking with the producers at the VSL studio to see if they would be willing to host us? A week from today is short notice, but we don't have any longer to waste.
I’ll have it done.
You’re very lucky to have someone like Jett as your team captain, Mach.
When I don't respond, he smirks.
Satisfied, Kim rises from his leather office chair. Jett and I quickly follow suit and exchange handshakes with him.
As he meets his palm with mine, Mr. Kim leans forward and whispers to me.
For the record, I would greatly prefer to see you succeed. Don’t let a mistake in the next week end your career before it's begun.
Nonchalantly, he parts from our grip and departs the conference room with long strides. His secretary skitters after him down the hallway, leaving Jett and me to find our own way back to the elevator.
Well, you came to Golden Zonefire looking for a chance. Now you’ve got one. Happy?
You stuck up for me.
Yes. And?
I just... I guess I thought that you'd have done what was best for the team.
Who said I'm not? Mr. Kim? I don't recall putting him in charge of team management.
What kind of team captain would I be if I tossed you out onto the street after recruiting Stunt and Reva?
I don't know. You said yourself that you wouldn't put the goals of a friendship ahead of the goals of your team.
Oh, in that case, it's not too late for me to go tell Mr. Kim I've changed my mind.
If you insist on paying me back, do so by practicing hard and beating the shit out of Bolt. It's been way too long since I've seen him lose in person.
And, for the record, I know what I said. But the more I think about it, the more messed up it seems that we’d waste our careers with people we hate.
So, for now, I've decided that I like you. Don’t make me regret that.
So much for cold efficiency. And I'll do my best.
As is expected of anyone that wears my team's colors.
Now c'mon. Before someone mistakes Accel for a bum.
Just before the elevator doors close, Mr. Kim turns the corner of his office and watches us go.
My legs are sore by the time we make it back to Namdan. Weeks of huddling up in my apartment obviously hasn’t been great for my personal fitness.
I catch sight of Stunt by his wild hair. He's the first to notice Jett and me and calls at us with a wave.
Yoooooooo! Is the team dead?
Not yet, and not for a while if our plan works out.
Accel sits up from his reclined position, while Reva has hardly moved at all since she came into view.
Plan?
Mach is going to win a showmatch.
Reva takes hold of her glasses, gears visibly turning in her head as she works out the point of a showmatch. Accel and Stunt simply look to me for the answer.
Mr. Kim agreed to sponsor us if we can redeem the team's image. I have to win a series against Bolt.
Bolt? That surly protoss on Shock? He's a Brood War player, though.
He plays Star2 on his own time. With money and the chance to embarrass a foreigner on the line, he has to accept.
And you’re okay with this, Mach?
Accel glances in my direction, genuine concern etched in his expression. He seems to be picking up on the doubt I’m feeling.
Yeah. Of course. I mean, I’m going to practice as hard as I can for the next week.
As will Bolt.
I don’t have anything to say to that. She’s right, after all.
The five of us take a moment to reflect on the severity of the situation. Gradually, I find the eyes of my teammates drifting towards me.
I wipe the sweat from my neck and steady myself with a breath.
I’m sure that I can handle this, but not all on my own.
Obviously! Listen, if he's a protoss, I'm down to grind out endless games. You and me, Mach!
Bolt's play has more depth than proxies and one base all-ins.
Do you have a better idea!? What the hell would she get out of practicing with a terran or a zerg?
Stunt pulls out his phone and dons a stubborn expression. Jett rolls her eyes and glances past him.
Everyone has a role to play in making sure that this team lives on past a botched showmatch. Stunt may—
She winces and then glances begrudgingly in the young protoss’ direction.
—be the only one of us that plays protoss enough to spar with Mach, but this is still a group effort. Accel, you get to test out your coaching chops.
He raises a thumb up without bothering to stand.
You know it.
Reva, work with Mach on openings and strategies. And I’ll see what I can do to get my hands on a few of Bolt’s replays.
Affirmative.
We don’t have any time to waste. Bolt’s going to be preparing for this match with a KPGA regimen.
Think you can handle fourteen hours a day, Mach?
I don’t need to practice long, I just need to practice smart.
You need to do both.
Yeah, she's right. It’s only for a week, anyway.
The idea of fourteen hours of high-level StarCraft is enough to make my wrists sore. Still, I have to live up to my team's expectations.
Alright. Do we start tonight?
Obviously.
...
Ehhhhhhh.......
Jett’s stare is enough to get him to spit it out.
I kinda… maybe… sorta promised my mom that I’d make up all the chores I've been skipping out on at our PC bang.
...
Look! I thought the team was definitely over, okay!? We’re StarCraft players, don’t pretend you guys don’t know the importance of time efficiency!
I need to start smoothing things over with her if I’m going to move out. C’mon, don’t look at me like that...
Useless. Whatever, we’ll meet up at Golden Zonefire tomorrow and every day after that up until the showmatch. Mach, just ladder tonight.
Right.
Reva, you free?
Yes. Why do you ask?
Go with Mach and watch her ladder for the rest of the day. See if you can pick up on any holes in her play.
Very well.
I've got to go confirm the schedule with Bolt, among other things. With me, Accel.
Should have guessed. Right then.
Stunt, go handle your bullshit. Golden Zonefire tomorrow morning. Go. Everyone. Go.
Accel peels himself off of the bench and falls in line beside Jett. Stunt is quick to follow, though he turns out of the park in different direction.
I was actually planning on going back to my apartment if I’m just going to ladder…
Oh. Should I return home?
No, no. Why don’t you meet me there in an hour? You won't need to stay too long.
Very well. I will see you in an hour.
After sharing the location of my apartment with a map from my phone, I bid her farewell. Reva fades along with green of Namdan when I trace back the path I took this morning.
My glazed-over eyes remain locked with the pavement as I amble my way home.
I know that I should feel relieved that our team still has a chance of coming together, but I can't help but worry.
I’m not carrying around the weight of my failed attempts to qualify for the VSL anymore. This is different.
It’s anxiety. A tightness in my chest that threatens to strangle me if I let everyone down.
I don’t know what I expected. It’s not like it’s going to get easier from here anyway. Every week in team league there’ll be a chance to cost my team a loss.
More than anything else, I’m frustrated by Mr. Kim's doubt. It's one thing for my friends and parents to misunderstand me, but Mr. Kim made an informed judgement that I'm not worth the trouble.
I jam my fists into my pockets and exhale deeply. If I ever doubted that eSports was brutal, I don’t any longer.
Short as the walk is, I don’t find my nerves calming as I settle into my pace.
A pack of energy drinks might help me douse my angst, so I decide to cut a detour that’ll take me past Go-Mart.
I should probably pick up something for Reva, too. It’d be a pretty classless move to make her watch me grind out ladder games without offering anything in return.
My older brother used to always make me watch him play games back when we were kids.
This is different though. She’s not watching me for fun, she’s watching to tell me how badly I suck.
I brush past another customer on my way into Go-Mart and glance towards the register. Mr. Yeon smiles in my direction, but then immediately walks into the store’s back room.
I don’t waste time browsing and head straight for the refrigerators.
By the time I’m done shopping, Mr. Yeon comes out from the back room with a brown box in hand and makes his way back to the register.
I set my bottles and cans down on the counter and offer the old man a nod.
Hello. This is all for today.
In a rush, are we?
Oh, uh. Not really. Why?
With word that I won't run off, Mr. Yeon smiles wide and hoists the box up onto the counter, pushing aside my drinks in the process.
I blink, dumbfounded. But before I can ask what he’s doing, he clicks open a latch and reveals a wooden board on the underside of the box’s lid.
He flips it up and sets the box between us in the place where a customer might expect to have their groceries rung up.
A cloth sack rests beside the game board, the contents of which clack against one another and the counter. He pulls an object out of the bag and shows it to me.
Have you ever played Go?
Go, huh? It’s a board game that’s played mostly in Asia, held in esteem similar to chess. Without meaning to, I ask the first question on my mind.
Uh. Is this because I told you about my pro-gaming career?
Let’s just say I wouldn’t be showing it to you if you didn’t. We’ll go over the rules and play a round. Just one, and my whim will be satisfied.
Um. Alright.
This is strange. But if I want to keep shopping at Go-Mart, turning down Mr. Yeon will make our future interactions uncomfortable.
Better for one extremely awkward game of Go than an infinite amount of semi-awkward trips to the convenience store.
Mr. Yeon pours the contents of the bag into a pair of wooden cups set beside the board. On closer inspection, they appear worn and scratched up.
The board itself isn’t in great condition either. The corners are chipped and its lacquer is long faded.
Even though I’ve never played, I’m familiar with the premise of Go. Mr. Yeon explains the basic rules thoroughly either way. 
The main objective is to control and capture space by surrounding your opponent’s pieces. It's not unlike StarCraft in that sense. Only, there’s no advantage in quick fingers.
Even if I’m aware of the basics, I don’t have the faintest clue about the game's strategy. What is this supposed to accomplish?
Once Mr. Yeon is finished explaining the rules, he motions towards my stones.
Black takes the first move. You may begin whenever you're ready.
Okay. For the record, I have no idea what I’m doing here.
That’s alright. Just play on instinct.
It’s hard to hide the confusion I’m feeling, but I agree and shuffle a handful of black stones in my direction anyway.
If the point of Go is to control space, it seems like a good idea to form some sort of basic structure that I can play off of later.
But not five turns into the game, Mr. Yeon begins placing his pieces dangerously close to mine. When I look up from the board, he answers me only with a smile.
Soon, he begins capturing my stones with relentless efficiency, never allowing me to challenge his position when I’m so focused on protecting my own.
I fight back to defend my territory, but the clerk's plan is always a step ahead. I fix the board with an intense stare, certain that I can somehow unlock the intricacies of Go by demanding it of myself.
When the board is halfway full, it becomes readily apparent that I’m going to lose.
Mr. Yeon glances up from the board with a raised eyebrow, smile ever-present.
Would you care to stop? I don’t mean to keep you for too long.
No, it's fine. Let’s finish.
After turning down the chance to concede, it feels appropriate that I’d somehow stage an amazing comeback. But the beatdown only continues.
Towards the end of the match, Mr. Yeon manages to capture more than half of my stones in a single move. My displeasure makes itself apparent with a groan.
I deliver my last few turns to the board hard enough to echo a clack throughout the store. Mr. Yeon scratches his chin casually, scanning the carnage he’s wrought upon my pieces.
Hm. I don’t see any possible moves. I pass.
And I pass too. That means the game is over, right?
That is correct.
I release the breath I’ve been holding in, relieved.
I’m so glad to live in an era where video games exist.
The old man replaces his Go set in the bag and box, and clears the counter of our diversion. Yet instead of reaching for my drinks to scan, he sets his eyes on me.
You play to avoid losing.
I feel a frown form on my face. Why exactly am I getting a lesson on an Eastern board game from a cashier?
I don't say anything, so he continues.
Specifically, you play to avoid the pain of a loss. It's clear to see when you have no learned habits or memorized strategies.
There's nothing inherently wrong with playing that way, but you should be aware of the fact. I’m a firm believer that games showcase personality in its purest form.
Was this whole thing just an excuse to share some wisdom you couldn't think of any other way to bring up?
... Tch. I said that with way more disrespect than I should have. Nevertheless, Mr. Yeon’s slight smile doesn’t falter.
Perhaps. Or perhaps I’m just looking for a conversation.
You didn’t quit when I gave you the chance. That’s good. But you can only go so far without playing for the win.
StarCraft isn’t so different from Go. I know that because life isn’t so different from Go. Strive to win, Mach. Not to not lose.
I don’t understand.
Try to. It's an important lesson.
A serious glint flickers across Mr. Yeon's face for a fraction of a second. When it's gone, he looks no different than before.
There’s no one else that moves those drinks off the shelf like you! I’m incentivized to have you succeed and stick around, you see.
He lets out a laugh, one that continues only until I smile politely in response. When he's done, Mr. Yeon rings up my drinks and hurries them into a bag.
Right, off you go. I won’t ask you to play again with me—unless you'd like to.
Um. Alright.
I lower my head in a bow. Not the type reserved for a venerable elder, but at least one to show that I’m thankful.
The door rings when I hurry through it, leaving Mr. Yeon to endure the sickly linoleum of his store alone. 
In a roundabout way, I think Mr. Yeon’s little diversion might actually help.
It’s nice to know that he cares enough about me to offer advice, even if it’s just because I shop at his store.
Whether or not that business about Go and not losing is true remains to be seen. Is an aversion to losing really that ingrained in my DNA?
... Go-Mart. Huh.
Alright Mr. Yeon, I’ll admit that’s pretty clever.
It seems much darker outside than it was when I came into the store. I reach to check the time on—shit!
I have a half dozen missed calls from Reva. Did that Go match seriously take more than an hour?!
An urgent need to get back to my apartment replaces my thoughts of Mr. Yeon and board games. 
I weave through pedestrians as best I can while simultaneously texting an apology to Reva.
My feet carry me as fast as they can. If Reva got tired of waiting in front of my door and left, I’m screwed.
I pant my way up my apartment’s stairs and pause in the hallway to find that she isn’t there. Frustrated, I sigh and force open my door.
I'm dead. I'm so dead. Why didn't I keep track of the time? Why now, why when so much is on the line?
As I rack my brain for an excuse I can offer Jett, I look up to find that my apartment is already occupied.
You are late.
She rises from her seat on my bed and points at the computer.
Ladder.
How… How are you in my room?
The door was not locked. I let myself in when you failed to answer my calls.
You just… came in?
Yes.
My breathing calms as my panic subsides. I forgot to lock my door, huh? I guess this is better than showing up to find my computer missing.
Right. Okay. Sorry, I got caught up with some old guy. Here.
With a rustle, I reach into the bag I’m carrying and hand a drink to Reva.
Caught up?
Reva takes my offering without so much as looking at it. Whether or not she’s actually going to drink it, I’ve done my due diligence as a host.
It’s hard to explain.
You do not need to explain your relationship with an old man if you would rather not.
Even though I’m pretty sure it’s a joke, Reva doesn’t smile to show it. I offer a nervous laugh and fall into my computer chair, trying to move on from the topic of my tardiness.
So, uh. Right. Ladder. Is there something you think I need to practice?
You will want to match against protoss players only. Quit the match if your opponent is terran or a zerg.
Wait... But my ranking!
With a few keystrokes, I display my proudly earned grandmaster badge accompanied by a rank in the double digits.
If I leave two thirds of my games tonight, I’m going to lose a bunch of ladder points.
Are your ladder points really that important?
Absolutely.
Well...
Without a word, Reva takes the mouse from me and logs out of StarCraft 2. Her fingers dance across the keyboard, and a second later we’re logged into her barcode account.
The grandmaster badge accompanying Reva's anonymous username is ranked even higher than mine.
Play on this one then. I do not care about ladder rank, and neither should you.
I scratch behind my head and have the sense to look embarrassed. She’s right. It’s pretty dumb for me to worry about ladder rank at a time like this.
With a nod and a click, I search for my first match of the night. It takes a handful of games before I’m finally matched up against a protoss.
Ugh, he’s got one of those weird names with random capitalization.
Reva sits just over my shoulder from the edge of my bed, eyes fast on the monitor.
Your APM is low.
I wince and respond with a flurry of unneccesary keystrokes. I’ve never cracked 300 APM, even when I’m focused on doing so.
A minute or two passes without comment, though it’s hard to tell whether or not that means she thinks I’m playing well.
Your engineering bays are late.
Are they? They are. Dammit. I whip my mouse hard, box a pair of SCVs, and slam down the two delayed structures.
Delayed upgrades or no, I manage to keep a close enough eye on my opponent’s tech that I have a massive swell of vikings by the time his colossus come into play.
His army gets caught in an awkward position when he tries to establish his third base, allowing me to power forward into his base. It’s a win I’d normally celebrate with a self-assured smile.
But with Reva over my shoulder, I’m forced to feign humility in my victory. I turn towards her and motion towards the screen.
Well? What do you think?
She adjusts her glasses and purses her lips, taking a long moment to decide on her response.
He was bad. But you capitalized on his mistakes, so I have no major complaint.
A good player won’t let you obtain free information. Use your scans wisely.
I thought I used them pretty well, didn’t I? Scouting is one of the things I’m best at.
Not particularly. And you should always aim to be even better.
I grumble and turn to queue up another game. Yet another thing to focus on, I guess.
I had thought that Reva’s low-key attitude might have made her a little bit lenient with my mistakes. But she’s not all that different from Jett, minus how she delivers her criticism.
My next match is on the largest map in the current ladder pool. I’ll have a pretty easy time defending my expansions with the way that the map’s choke points are constructed.
Rather than poke and prod with marines or go for early aggression, I throw down a quick third base in a far-flung corner of the map shortly after I begin my first expansion.
Pulling off this kind of tactic is incredibly rewarding. If it goes unscouted, I'm practically guaranteed to win.
Why are you doing that? Practice something useful.
I shift my gaze aside to find Reva uncomfortably close to both me and the monitor.
What if I decide to hide an expansion against Bolt?
Are you going to risk the team on a coinflip? Cancel it and aim for a long game.
Reva offer the advice too firm to be called a suggestion, and I find myself moving the mouse to do as instructed. This gaffe is going to set me back a fair bit.
I gear up for a drawn out match by focusing on my upgrades and base defense. It’s not long before my protoss opponent and I have split the map in half and are jockeying for position.
Build more defenses. You can afford a dozen planetary fortresses.
Is that really necessary?
Mach, your opponent is protoss. Protoss players will stop at nothing to cheat an honest terran out of an earned win.
Funny. I typically imagine balance whiners as loud and obnoxious in real life. I wonder if she quit playing random out of guilt.
Still, I oblige her and cram as many static defense structures as I can into a vital choke point.
There is an observer over your army.
I squint to find that she’s right. Damn, how did I not catch that earlier? With a scan, I pick off the protoss scout and reposition my units.
It takes a few minutes to adjust my army composition to one that better suits the extreme late game, but I’m soon ready to clash with my opponent.
At this point, StarCraft becomes less about strategy and more about patience. It's important to know when to stalk and when to pounce.
I sense an opening at last and rush into my opponent’s weak flank. Out of the corner of my eye I can see Reva tensing up, invested as much as I am in the outcome of the battle.
But try as I might, my snipes don’t connect with the high templar scattered amongst the protoss army.
He drowns my units in psi storm and steamrolls down the center of the map, destroying my constructed defenses along the way.
I struggle pointlessly to mount a counteroffensive, but the damage is done. I’m forced to tap out a gg and quit the match with a huff.
He controlled his army better than you did.
I spin in my chair to face Reva with a frown.
If he didn’t, I would have won. Ugh, that was so close!
Yes, it was.
At least she can concede a point to my credit when it’s deserved. But damn, that match took a while. As long as Go with Mr. Yeon, if not longer.
What time do you need to leave?
Are you throwing me out?
What? No. I’m just saying if you need to be home at a certain time, let me know.
I do not.
Okay.
Sheesh. Why does talking to her feel so unnatural? This has to be intentional on her part.
I need a break.
Your opponents will use every wasted moment to become better than you. Breaks are dangerous.
Just a short one! I’m thirsty, anyway. We’ll be back on the ladder with a vengeance afterwards.
Hm... 
Thirsty... 
I see.
My fist clenches involuntarily as I reach for a can, nearly forcing me to knock it over. I offer Reva an exhausted look before cracking open my drink.
Not to be outdone, I take a poised sip before glancing casually in her direction.
So, why do you pretend to be a guy on the internet?
Now it’s Reva’s turn to tense up. Her face contorts, eyes glazing over as if scanning her internal database for a scathing comeback.
404, comeback not found.
I do no such thing! Details about my private life are kept just so: private. Others simply assume.
Well, that’s all coming to an end if we’re going to be on Team Enoch, isn’t it?
I suppose.
Excited about living in a team house?
As long as it is being paid for, yes.
In it for the eSports money, I see.
Of course. Since primary school I have dreamed of my own bunk bed and free cup noodles.
Reva is refreshingly realistic about pro-gamer living conditions. Maybe she can talk some sense into Stunt.
To be frank, anything is better than life back at home.
Oh? Trouble with your parents?
No. My parents worked hard to give me the opportunities they never had, and for that I will always be grateful. But they live far from Seoul, so I was isolated from my friends for most of my life.
You mean your online friends?
Yes. But now, I have the chance to make my own way. I take pride in the fact that I have turned my skills into a living, no matter how meager.
You should be. Most people living off of StarCraft do it with the support of a team, but you've managed on your own. You have the right to be proud.
Maybe. But sometimes, even though I am happy with my accomplishments, I lack the confidence to devote more of myself to this game.
Really? I wouldn’t have expected to hear something like that from you.
Why?
I don’t know. You kinda seem like the resolute type. No regrets. That sort of thing.
I’m bad at putting into words my impression of Reva, but she seems to understand what I mean by the nod she offers.
You are correct that I always give full effort to my pursuits.
However, this is not a matter of regret. Normally, I can be satisfied even in failure if I have done my best.
But what if the task was not worth working towards in the first place?
What do you mean? eSports is like anything else, isn’t it? It’s a climb to the top.
It is. But StarCraft is inherently less valuable than most other things. Art, athletics, education, science, a corporate career. Objectively, my time is better spent on almost anything other than pro-gaming.
But I do not believe I can truly distinguish myself at any of those things, while it is possible as a pro-gamer.
I was born in the right country, I am the correct age, and I have enough required talent.
Even then, it is not logical for me to spend so much time and effort on what should statistically prove unrewarding. Yet I cannot bring myself to turn down the chance to compete.
I have the same drive, so I can at least understand that. But you really won't do something if you can’t be the best at it? And the way you talk about your motivation...
Do you even like StarCraft?
No. I don't.
She answers bluntly and then looks away. I have nothing to say to that.
High level StarCraft isn't always fun in the traditional sense of the word, but it sounds like Reva genuinely doesn't enjoy the game.
For her to be as good as she is with that holding her back is hard to understand.
StarCraft's greatest players have always credited their love of the game as a major factor in their success. How far can she hope to go without that advantage?
With silence filling the space between us, Reva takes the opportunity to try out the drink I brought for her. On the first taste, she screws her face up and hurries to set it down.
How can you stand something so sugary?
I shrug, since I don’t have a good answer. It’s not like I can explain why something tastes good.
Where are you living if not with your parents?
Do you know what a goshiwon is?
... No way. Really?
That’s a term that showed up in one of my online lessons. If I remember correctly, it’s an absurdly tiny type of apartment. Literally the size of a closet, with a low price to match.
I live on the edge of Seoul, so rent is inexpensive. I pay with my winnings from online tournaments.
Matches on the last week of every month if I have not yet hit my quota can be very stressful. That has been my life since I graduated from high school.
Damn. You don’t mind the lack of space?
I do. I am enjoying the chance to stretch while it lasts.
She demonstrates by falling back onto my bed and fully extending her legs. I shake my head and try not to laugh.
It’ll last. The team house will be a nice upgrade for the both of us.
Reva sits up and rests her arms on her knees.
Break time is over. Return to the ladder.
Alright, alright.
I spin my chair back towards my computer and resume my training.
The blue light from my computer monitor shines in Reva’s glasses, her advice and my grumbling all that is said between us.
The matches bleed into each other, one foe falling after another. I’m in a protoss-slaying groove.
Reva goes quiet in the middle of a particularly intense game, leaving only the sounds of my keyboard and mouse clicks to mingle with the game sounds blasting from my headphones.
I manage to prolong my win streak with a multi-pronged attack that forces my opponent to tap out. With a triumphant grin, I push off the desk and turn.
Boom! Three in a…
... And find that Reva has fallen asleep on duty.
Well. That explains why she didn’t point out that my dropships were delayed. Is it really that late?
I rest my hand against my cheek. Should I wake her up and tell her to go home?
Ugh. She looks too peaceful for me to do that in good conscience. I can just sleep on the floor, I guess.
I bunch up a hoodie from my dresser into a makeshift pillow and ease myself into the space under my desk. The ground isn’t exactly comfortable, but with enough shifting around I find a decent spot.
Not long after, my eyelids grow heavy and sleep claims me.
I'm on the floor. Why am I on the floor?
The trash on my desk is gone and my bed is made. Hm.
... Right. Reva.
When I stand, an ache in my back forces me to wince. It’s nothing serious, but I must have turned over in my sleep onto a weird angle.
A text message from Reva awaits me when I check my phone for the time.
... She borrowed some of my clean clothes? Really?! Ugh, well, at least she admitted it.
The week ahead is going to be tough. Six days probably isn’t enough time to make any sort of serious breakthrough in terms of my mechanics or game sense.
But it’s long enough to craft a game plan that might edge out Bolt. My biggest issue with the matchup is that I have no idea what to expect from him.
How does a Brood War player go about learning StarCraft 2? Maybe I should ask Jett or Accel.
Whatever the case, the team is probably waiting for me at Golden Zonefire. I should hurry over.
By noon, my wrists are sore from a morning of anti-rush defense. Without anything specific to practice against, Stunt spammed me with game after game of proxy gates, cannon rushes, and one base all-ins.
I feel prepared in the incredibly unlikely case that Bolt risks the match on something like a two gate. Stunt’s a one-note protoss, but he plays that note pretty damn well.
Can you try something else for a change? My brain is starting to fry.
Heh, I’m not even warmed up yet. You're only able to defend against these builds because you're expecting them.
Obviously! The point of a cheese is to catch the opponent off guard! What's the point of cheesing when it's literally all you can do?!
Ugh, you don’t understand. Cheesing is an art. An art that I will be the first to master.
Seriously though, Mach needs to prepare for more than just your one-base all-ins. Try playing standard for a change.
Ehh. Fine.
Just then, Jett steps through the doors of Golden Zonefire at a fierce pace, saving me from more of Stunt’s abusive builds.
But the relief I feel at her arrival shatters when I catch sight of the figure at her heels.
Before I can form a question at Bolt’s presence, both he and Jett are standing before us. She shoots an annoyed glance at him before speaking.
He insisted on speaking with you before he would agree to play.
Bolt lifts his chin at me, savoring the moment. I need something from him—a showmatch—and he’s well aware of the power it grants him.
So, Mach. Still desperate to make a name for yourself?
I match his aloof expression with a hard one, determined to show that he can't intimidate me.
Our sponsor needs a demonstration of the team’s potential. It’s not about me.
Don’t kid yourself, this is all about you. I’d be facing Jett, Accel, or one of the wannabe dishwashers you managed to clown into signing if it wasn't. Do you think I haven't read what they're saying online?
I draw in a sharp breath, to Bolt’s amusement. He shakes out his wrist and offers a shrug.
I normally have better things to do than play out a showmatch in a lesser game. But hey, you’ve caught me at a good time.
My next Brood War match isn’t for a few weeks. Got just enough time to brush up on my SC2 and ship you back across the Pacific.
Did you know that my team manager won’t even let me play Star2 in the Shock team house? They say it’s distracting to the other players.
I reach for another calming breath, but find no relief. It’s that smile of his.
What, you came here just to talk some trash? Quit wasting my time and accept the match.
I accept. And I’ll do you one better than you’ll do me. Catch.
Bolt pulls something out of his pocket and tosses it at me. My reflexes don’t fail me and I snag the small, black object in midair.
When I open my hand, I find a thumb drive.
What…?
Fifty replays. Study them all you like. You'll have no excuse when you lose.
By the way Jett, let me give you a tip. Next time you go behind my back for replays, don't try to get them from someone that shares my feelings on your opportunist bullshit.
Your foreigner mascot is lucky that I'm feeling generous.
With an infuriating air of superiority, Bolt turns to leave. My teammates visibly share my frustration, but none of them rush to my defense.
Maybe it’s for good reason. I can't keep relying on Jett or Accel to bail me out of trouble.
Beating Bolt isn't their responsibility. It's mine.
Hey, Bolt.
He turns, mild surprise showing on his face when I flick the thumb drive out of my hand and at his feet.
I won't lose to you again. Remember it.
Tell yourself that.
He shows his teeth in a smirk and crushes the flash drive under his heel.
Just like you told yourself you could qualify for VSL.
Bits of plastic and metal are all that remains of the USB when he lifts his foot to continue on his way out.
The tension remains long after Bolt's departure. Finally, Jett enters my personal space, eyes sharp and locked with mine.
Why did you do that?! We needed his replays!
Accel steps forward and places a hand on Jett’s shoulder.
Bolt was trying to get into Mach’s head. You know that, Jett. It was the right call.
Dang. He really didn’t feel like leaning over to pick it up, huh? Those things are like ten thousand won.
The quip earns him a perplexed stare from Accel and Jett. I'm too distracted to even react.
Whatever. Mach, if you’re going to be showy, save it for when it’ll gain you some fans.
That gives me an idea for a ceremony after you beat this guy! Get like ten flash drives and—
Hey Stunt, I’ve got a better idea for a ceremony. We sign a contract with Enoch and move into our team house. How’s that sound?
That’s not as funny as what I had in mind.
Enough banter. Get back to practicing.
... Can we take a break or something? I need a minute.
We don't have a minute, especially without replays. Practice. Now.
I quietly follow Stunt's lead back towards the PCs. Accel and Jett move in and take their seats behind us.
From the top. And no rushes, Stunt.
I have absolutely no clue how anyone can practice for more than ten hours a day.
My wrists ache. My eyes hurt. My subconscious won’t consider anything but unit compositions and attack timings. And I can't get Bolt's stupid smirk out of my head.
Worse still, with Jett forcing Stunt to play standard, our practice wasn't productive at all.
She didn't seem happy with me when she left to meet with the producers at the VSL studio. But after so many games, it becomes impossible for me to focus.
What else are we supposed to do? Reva doesn’t seem like she’s in practice for any race but terran.
Do I even have a chance against Bolt? Did I ever in the first place?
Dude. How does anyone macro!? It’s boring, exhausting, and makes you consider zillion variables. Economy management is so stupid.
You just described what StarCraft is supposed to be, minus the boring part.
Well I don’t like it. I’m at my best when I can focus microing. Who says I should have to play a game past the ten minute mark?
No one, as long as you're okay with an awful winrate.
With practice done for the day, I agreed to join Accel and Stunt for dinner while Jett deals with logistics and setup for the match.
I’m led down a smoky side street where greasy and fragrant smells mingle. My experience with street food so far hasn’t been great, but I trust the judgement of Stunt and Accel.
Row after row of stalls are thick with customers clamoring for a hot meal. The three of us browse the various offerings before Stunt insists on one in particular.
Do you like bindaetteok, Mach?
Sure, yeah. Whatever's fine.
The single cook manning the stall cleaves through customer orders faster than I think possible. It isn’t long before we’re walking away from the stall, paper wrapped pancake in hand.
We settle for a seat on the curb, far enough away from the foot traffic to avoid being trampled.
Reva’s going to run into trouble with Jett if she doesn’t show at Golden Zonefire again this week.
Eh. She can only help Mach so much. Besides, it’s not like she can skip out on practice at the team house.
Have you ever even been inside a team house, Stunt?
The protoss forces down his food with a thump to the chest.
No. But I’ve seen pictures.
It’s an informal setting. It isn't hard to sleep in or slack off, but the type of people that do that usually don’t become pro-gamers. Or, at the least don’t last long as one.
We still don’t have any subs. Isn't that going to be a problem?
Let’s worry about one thing at a time. There won’t be much need for subs if we don’t do our best this week.
Still, the team is tiny. Five people, including management? Jett wasn’t kidding when she said she wanted a lean team.
The sudden thought of a team goshiwon is almost enough to make me smile.
Yo, Accel. What did you do with all of your prize money from Brood War?
That’s kind of a personal question, isn’t it?
I don’t mind answering. Spent about half of it on general living expenses and stuff for my family. The rest I’ve got saved.
Lame. What’s the point of winnings if you don’t spend them?
I've earned forty million won or so, not counting salary. That may sound like a lot, but it’s easy to go through if you aren’t responsible.
Deaf to the sense Accel is trying to talk into him, Stunt stares off into space with stars in his eyes.
If I won the VSL Grand Final, I’d buy a car, a house, a new PC........
He continues, rattling off a list of a dozen superfluous objects in a way that only someone who has lived without worrying about paying rent can.
Accel and I both take the chance to eat without interruption.
Jett’s still got the hundred million won from the first VSL Championship, yeah?
That plus some, probably. Why?
I wonder if I could convince her to trick out the team house...
Feel free to ask. Just make sure I'm there for her reaction.
What about you, Mach? What would you do with your big winnings?
I don't know. Save it or something.
God. The chicks on our team are all so boring.
Don’t forget that all the time you spend climbing StarCraft's ladder, someone else spends climbing the corporate ladder. If you're only in eSports for the money, just get a real job.
Psh, it’s no big deal. After I make it big as the next protoss bonjwa, I’ll just get a job as a coach or a team owner. I’ve got it all planned out.
There’s no convincing Stunt at this rate, not that I can blame him. I wasn’t any more responsible when I was his age.
With a final bite, what’s left of my bindaetteok is little more than grease on a napkin. I’m joined by my teammates when I move to toss away the trash.
Heading home, Mach?
Yeah. Gonna ladder for a bit and then sleep.
Gotcha. I’ll be at the cafe by ten. Don’t be late.
Not like we have anything better to do.
The three of us turn separate ways out of the alley. I endure the walk back to my apartment in silence.
I stare at my cellphone, the light coming from its screen bright enough to make my eyes glaze.
Then, it goes dark, and I slide my thumb over its screen to wake it.
I’ve repeated this ritual four times now.
My head falls back against my chair, and I close my eyes. Why do I feel like this?
It’s been almost two weeks since I last spoke with my parents. Admittedly, I’ve been busy with StarCraft since I met Accel and Jett, but I’m still overdue for a call.
My finger hovers over the contact number. Before it can fall to dial them, the phone escapes my hand and falls back onto the desk.
Does it really matter? I don’t have much to say. 
‘Hi Mom, is Dad there? Yes everything is fine. No, I’m not dead. No, I haven’t given up yet.’
Telling them about the team might be for nothing. They'll pretend to share my happiness in a victory, but there’s always an underlying cynicism to every congratulation from them.
A win isn’t a win. It’s another crumb leading me to chase a pointless eSports dream and away from the life they think I should be living.
It feels wrong to be cross with them. They raised me, paid for my existence. I’d be an ingrate to ask for more.
And yet, I do. I want them to accept my goals for what they are. To hope for more than that I’ll grow out of StarCraft.
It’s the same with my friends from high school. They pretend not to, but I know that they look down on me.
'It’s a video game. Why do you care so much? Do something that you're better suited for.'
When is it right to give up on a dream? How many failures does it take before you say: Alright, I’m done trying. I’ll just take a job at the family business.
If I lose to Bolt, should I quit StarCraft? Would it be nothing but pride to continue on?
Even if I win, what then? What if the team does poorly? What if the team does well, but I hold them back?
Will StarCraft 2 even last as long as Brood War? What if there isn’t any prize money left in the scene in a year from now? What if I start to hate the game?
It's wrong to think this way before such a high stakes match, but I can’t help it. I know what matters, and I know what I have to do. Why can't I just do it?
I carry myself onto the bed and bury my face in my pillow.
Somehow, I think I’m finally starting to understand what Mr. Yeon was saying.
I’m awake.
I’ve been awake, actually, but I don’t feel like getting up.
I tell myself to for the third time, but I don’t.
'We have to practice.'
But I don’t feel like practicing.
'Hey. Get up. The team is waiting for you.'
I just want to lie here though. Can’t I just do that?
'No.'
I’m probably sick from the street food. I’m just going to lie here until I feel better.
'You aren’t sick. Get up.'
Not now. Soon, though.
'Don’t you want to beat Bolt? That guy is a total prick. If you don’t practice, he’ll beat you and you’ll feel terrible.'
I already feel terrible though. I'm just going to lay here.
'Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up.
The sound of repeated, unrelenting knocks wakes me. A glance at my phone answers my immediate question. It’s 2:00 PM.
I shamble my way to my door and glance through the peephole into the hallway.
It’s Jett. She doesn’t look happy.
I turn the knob and crack the door open, offering no resistance when she forces it the rest of the way open.
She glances over me, not bothering to veil the disgust in her expression.
What are you doing? The entire team has been waiting for you to show up.
Her tone demands an answer, and I rush to oblige it with an excuse.
I don’t feel well.
You look fine. Get dressed and get your ass to Golden Zonefire.
I run a hand through my matted hair and glance away.
I’m serious, I feel awful. I don’t think practicing today 
makes much since considering I might burn myself out. It's important that I
Jett's palm cracks against the left side of my face. I call out in a mixture of pain and shock and try to step back.
Instead, Jett catches me by my shirt and pulls me forward, visibly restraining herself from bringing the back of her hand across my other cheek.
I gasp for breath and bring a hand to where she struck me. Her eyes, hard and determined, refuse to leave mine.
What... why... did you do that...
Why are you here, Mach? Why did you come to Korea?
What…? To… to play StarCraft. You already know the answer...
No, you didn’t. You have some natural talent for StarCraft, but you didn’t come here to make use of it.
What on Earth is she talking about? I feel my voice harden in my throat when I argue back.
You just hit me for nothing! I came to Korea because I want to play in the VSL! Because I want to be a champion.
And yet you can’t drag your sorry ass out of bed to prep for the showmatch that an entire team is counting on you to win.
Stop lying to yourself. Or at the very least, stop lying to me. I put a lot of trust in you, Mach. I honestly hoped that you’d prove you have what it takes to make something of yourself.
But you clearly don’t. You quit when it gets hard, and your minor accomplishments help fuel the lie that you're capable something great without putting in the work.
The ferocity in Jett’s eyes dies out as she relinquishes her vice on my undershirt. I stumble back, clutching at the wall to keep from falling over.
You have less than a week to pretend that you care about what happens to yourself and to this team.
If you can't do that for your own sake, then do it for ours.
After ten long, sobering seconds of unanswered silence, she turns, stalks into the hallway, and slams the door.
The wall is rough against my side as I slide down it and onto the floor.
It's not long before I'm tired of replaying my stale reasoning.
My apartment's view of the Seoul skyline offers a moment's relief. It makes the decision a little bit easier.
One way or another, I'm not coming home.
The looks of disdain, the fake reassurances. It's all that's left for me once I step on that plane and admit that I'm a failure.
If I can't swing a single match victory with four other people carrying me, what can I possibly hope to accomplish with the rest of my life?
I let out a long breath. I'm tired. And even though I wouldn't mind falling asleep against this wall, I find myself rising to my feet.
Is it narcissism or masochism? It would be so much easier for me to just accept that I was never cut out for this in the first place.
I really just can't quit, huh?
This is such a joke.
Go-Mart’s chime sings out as I push my way into the store. Snow white hair and a wrinkly forehead perk up from behind the counter as I stand in the doorway of his store.
Mr. Yeon.
Hmm? Come for another round of Go, Mach? Or just here to take your drinks and scram?
It isn’t until he gets a good look at me that the smile drops off his face.
Something the matter?
Did you play Go professionally?
He nods once, so I continue.
Why did you play? What kept you going? How did you stop yourself from quitting?
A little philosophical, don’t you think? Take a breath, Mach. What's going on?
At first, I try to explain as vaguely as I can. But as Mr. Yeon nods along, allowing me to ramble uninterrupted, I find myself divulging more and more details. 
I stop only when it comes time to explain my encounter with Jett this afternoon and the evening I spent sitting in my apartment.
You're right. I go to whatever lengths I can to avoid pain, and I’ve done it all my life.
StarCraft is the only thing I’ve ever been decent at, and I can’t commit to it because I'm afraid I'll fail.
But it's not just that. I can't quit either. My biggest fear of all is admitting to myself that I'm not good enough. I want to believe that as long as I try, I'm not worthless.
I ran away to South Korea with the stupid idea that I could make something of myself. Like the world owed me something just for showing up.
I'm just tired. I don't want to run anymore.
Despite my ragged voice and slumped shoulders, Mr. Yeon finds himself a nonchalant smile.
Then don’t. It’s much easier to walk.
A slight chuckle escapes him. When it ends, he gestures past me to his store.
Mach. I’m closing in on seventy and work at a convenience store at two in the morning. Some would call that failure. But I don’t regret the days I spent studying and competing in Go.
If we live without pursuing our passions, what good is living at all?
Prizes, fame, status… These things are achieved by few. But every competitor must play for a love of the game and the pride of a well-earned victory.
Competition is a noble thing. It drives us to improve, innovate, and test the limits of who we are and what we can do. It took humans into space.
You wouldn’t seek a reason to keep at it if you didn’t already know there's value in that.
I lean onto the counter separating us, the tension in my chest softening.
I do. And you’re right. But I can’t stop worrying that it won’t be worth it in the end. Or that even if I try my best, I’ll fail.
You might not achieve everything you set out to, even if you work as hard as you can. No success worth chasing is ever guaranteed.
But do you want to spend the rest of your life wondering what you were capable of? My own answer to that was no.
I glance away and rake my hand through my hair. There’s no way that I’ve come this far only to give up now.
When I straighten up, he beams a pleased smile at me.
Now then. If I were you, I would head home and get some rest. You’ve got a match to prepare for, after all.
I find myself at an utter loss for words. Gratitude forms and falls apart between my lips a handful of times before I simply settle for a deep bow.
Thank you, Mr. Yeon.
You're welcome, Mach.
By the way, the next time you come by for an old man’s wisdom, you'll have to buy something first.
For the first time today, I catch myself smiling.
Heh. Okay, deal.
Just then, a customer pushes open the door to the store. Though there wasn’t much else I had to say, now is probably an appropriate time to depart.
As I turn to leave, Mr. Yeon lifts his fist at me.
Work hard.
I raise mine to match his.
I will.
Apprehension hangs over me as I stand before the doors to Golden Zonefire. Waiting won’t make this any easier.
With a stride belying my frantic heart rate, I make my way to a table seating the four teammates I neglected the day before.
But whatever reason I have to worry disappears when Accel catches sight of me. He rises from his chair and waves me over, leading Reva and Stunt to follow suit.
It’s only Jett that refuses eye contact with me. Even then, though she’s trying to hide it, I can tell that she’s relieved I’m here.
Hey, Mach. Ready for practice?
Yeah. And sorry about yesterday. It won’t happen again.
No sweat. Let’s make the most of the time we have left, yeah?
Yeah.
Alright. Stunt, Mach. Go setup your PCs and get to work.
Stunt jumps up from the table and steers himself to my side as we make our way to the setups.
Me and Reva played 2v2s while Jett was gone yesterday. I'm pretty sure we could be ranked number one on the ladder with enough time.
No one takes 2v2s seriously, much less on ladder.
Pft, says you. But hey, good that you're already feeling better. If you puke, I'll know it's because my build is what's sick.
I lift an eyebrow, trying to unravel Stunt's meaning. It's only with a glance back at Jett and then Accel that it clicks.
Yeah. I'm all better.
He snerks and peels away from my side to pick out a PC. Jett, Accel and Reva follow at a distance, the latter two setting up chairs behind me to observe and make comments.
Even with my renewed focus and drive, it becomes readily apparent after a few matches that our practice is still going to be suboptimal.
Stunt’s trying his best, but it doesn’t mean much with less than a week until the showmatch.
He simply doesn't execute standard builds very well. Accel says as much after I trip my way through another clumsy win.
We might need to look into finding someone else for Mach to practice with. But there really isn’t enough time...
It may be more productive for her to face opponents on ladder.
It won’t be possible for Mach to prepare against certain builds that way, but at this rate you might be right.
Stunt, no one’s going to deny your unit control, but you just don't have the strategic breadth of someone like Bolt.
The young protoss player slumps in his chair and stares off into space.
I know. Sorry.
Did I really come this far just to face Bolt unprepared? There has to be a solution.
Reva, do you think you could play in place of Stunt?
I have not played protoss in more than a month. Without a week's worth of practice, I would be a lesser opponent than Stunt.
Damn. Truth be told, even her terran micro isn’t all that great. I’d hate to see her try to control something like blink stalkers without the time to get back in shape.
Still, it seems wasteful that we haven’t been putting her game knowledge to good use.
Could we look around the cafe for a protoss, maybe?
Jett is first to answer, and does so without acknowledging me.
Look around. Half the people in here are playing this new MOBA bullshit. Decent StarCraft players only show up for All-Out Attack.
Unless they need a practice space for a showmatch, apparently.
He laughs to lighten the mood, but Jett is right. Looking for someone outside of the cafe will probably take too long as well.
None of Jett or Accel’s old teammates will want to help either, especially with the PR surrounding the team.
C'mon... Think. Be resourceful.
If Stunt isn’t providing enough strategies for me to prepare for, and Reva can’t put the strategies that she knows into action…
Wait a second! What Stunt said earlier...
What if we practiced 1v2?
Eh. What?
Stunt handles the units, and Reva handles the base management and picks the build order. That way, I can face the best of them both.
Will that even work?
Accel glances to Reva, who seems as surprised by my plan as he is.
I don’t see why it wouldn’t. It won’t be a perfectly realistic game condition, but it’s better than anything else I can think of.
That sounds kinda fun, actually. C’mon, Reva.
Stunt pats the seat of the station next to him. With a shrug, she rises to join him.
Very well.
Jett replaces herself in Reva’s vacated seat, arms crossed and expression fierce. She’s intent on seeing for herself whether or not this will work.
When Stunt is done joking about doing a fusion dance with Reva, we load up a game with Reva and Stunt on the same team and a setting enabled to keep Reva’s base from spawning.
So I don’t have to worry about anything except destroying Mach? This is going to be great. Hey, Reva, build two gateways by her base for me.
No. We are playing standard.
Come on... Okay, how about a proxy stargate then?
No.
I can hear you, you know.
It will not matter. Such is the beauty of standard play.
I soon find that her confidence is well placed. Even with Reva's economy-focused build order, Stunt's stalker harass soon makes my life difficult.
He dances the single unit back and forth at the entrance to my natural, all of his focus devoted to its control.
It's a painfully effective frustration that succeeds in slowing down my attempts at establishing economy and tech.
My multitasking and micro are brought to their limits, and we haven’t even hit the five minute mark. This is insane.
And very, very good practice.
I don’t have the chance to spare a glance over my shoulder at Accel or Jett, but I’d make a pretty sure bet that they’re just as intent on the game as Stunt, Reva, and I are.
The match drags on until the Stunt and Reva archon rolls over my paltry force with a well-timed and perfectly controlled two-base push. It wasn't even close.
Well. They make for a tough opponent, that’s for sure. You three down to keep at this?
Are you kidding?! This is amazing!
I am enjoying myself as well.
The point isn’t to have fun, it’s to practice.
Run a nexus first. I want to see how Mach handles it.
It’s incredible. Playing an opponent at this level allows me to see the game in an all new way.
Stunt’s control is precise and crashes against my defense like a wave, while Reva directs the flow of battle like a symphony's conductor.
They have achieved purity of form. Through these repeated losses, I can see just how outmatched I am in nearly every aspect of StarCraft.
The moments of weakness for an opponent that plays such a clean style are scant and short-lived, but they exist. I can create them by taking risks, using mind games, or forcing mistakes.
I've felt these things on instinct before, but I can now see them for the truths they are.
The element of human error is practically zero between Stunt and Reva.
But StarCraft is a game of imperfect information. Anyone, even a perfect machine, is capable of being defeated.
I'm done being afraid of you, Bolt.
It’s late in the evening when Accel calls our practice quits. Twelve hours straight, minus breaks for lunch and dinner.
Four more days of that, and she’ll be as ready as she possibly can be in that amount of time.
We risk Stunt and Reva falling out of practice, but there really isn’t any other choice. At least it won’t be for long.
Jett still hasn’t acknowledged me with direct eye contact, but the animosity I felt coming from her this morning is all but gone.
Neither Stunt or Reva seem even a fraction as out of it as I am. Yet as tired as I am, I find myself eager for practice tomorrow.
I can only hope it lasts until the end of the week.
I’ve got a few more things to take care of before the weekend. The VSL studio managed to fit us in a time slot right before the semi finals for team league.
I’ve seen some of the promotion they’re doing online. It’s being hyped as a KPGA vs. foreigner match.
Mach's been cast as the villain. A last minute way of hyping up the match since it was on such short notice.
The Korean Pro-Gamer Association would not have allowed one of their players to compete otherwise.
It seems they are beginning to sow the seeds for the transition from Brood War to StarCraft 2.
It’s hard to imagine that the talent pool for StarCraft 2 could get any more deep. Bolt is only one of a few dozen top-tier players being held back by the floodgates of KPGA’s regulations.
A win against Bolt ought to show KPGA players and their fanboys not to shrug off those of us who switched to StarCraft 2 early.
No need for so much bite, Jett. We switched because we were ready for a new challenge, right?
She glances away, failing to match Accel’s now wavering grin.
I need to go. The rest of you, get some rest.
Yo, Reva. Wanna grab some dinner? We can practice our fusion dance for tomorrow.
A potara earring is necessary for fusion between two distinct beings, Stunt. And the hyperbolic time chamber is a more apt metaphor for Mach’s training regimen regardless.
A bickering Stunt and Reva exit shortly behind the stone-eyed Jett, leaving only me and Accel to the half-empty cafe.
Don’t bother worrying about yesterday.
Jett told you, huh?
Even if she didn’t, it’d be an easy guess. You weren’t giving it your all when we called it quits the day before.
Figures.
A sigh escapes me, leading Accel to drop a hand on my shoulder.
Just focus on the showmatch. If you still want to worry about sleeping in after winning, you can mope around the team house for a day.
Despite my best efforts, I can’t keep myself from spitting out a laugh.
Things have changed so much since I met you and Jett.
For the better, I hope?
Yeah. You guys are so goal driven. It's kind of mindblowing, actually.
Best way to live, if you ask me. And good practice for the real challenge.
Don’t think Jett will be satisfied with a little bit of money from Enoch. You won't have time to pick the confetti out of your hair before hearing all about next season's plan.
If she ever finds a reason to talk to me again, that is.
Jett has her way of dealing with things. Don't sweat it too much and just focus on your practice.
Right, I will.
I rise from my chair at last, checking my pockets on the way up for my key and wallet.
Take care. I'm going to stick around and ladder for a while. Coach has to keep his skills current, you know.
Will you join the team as a player when your contract with Crash is up at the end of the year?
Who knows? Let’s just worry about the next few days, yeah?
Fair enough. Later, Accel.
He falls right back into his chair after a fist bump, leaving me to stalk the neon lit streets alone.
The city lights have never been so beautiful. I have no desire to leave Seoul’s electric embrace now that things are finally starting to make sense.
What if I hadn’t run into Accel at Golden Zonefire? I’d probably be booking my ticket for a flight home at the end of the month right about now.
And without Jett, there would be no team. No goal, past the vague dream to qualify for the VSL.
If not for Stunt or Reva, I’d have no sparring partners. No teammates. Not to mention, no way to have earned Jett's confidence in front of Mr. Kim.
... Mr. Kim. No matter how he rubs me the wrong way, he's as much a part of my chance to stay here as my teammates.
And Mr. Yeon. Who’d have thought that the convenience store clerk I’d been avoiding eye contact with would be the one to bring me back from the brink?
By whatever means necessary, I’ll repay those that have helped me stand where I do now.
For the third time, if you scout the second gas, build a damn bunker! Don’t be so greedy!
Make sure you stay clear of his vision if you’re going to take that kind of drop path.
They’ll try to roll over you with colossus if they manage to pick off your dropships. Prioritize your viking production first!
... Yes! Just like that.
With a couple of snipes on the Stunt + Reva combination’s high templar, the protoss army is left bereft any kind of area of effect damage, allowing me to charge forward and go for the jugular.
Even with Stunt’s top tier control and Reva’s highly efficient production, I manage to push my way into their base and secure not one, but two ggs.
I leap out of my seat in triumphant victory. Out of almost a hundred games, that’s the third win I’ve managed to clinch.
It feels amazing. I wasn't sure that I'd be able to manage a breakthrough as a result of this kind of practice, but my control has noticeably improved.
A good thing, considering the match with Bolt is tomorrow.
Gaaaah! She insisted on building more high templar when I asked for colossus!
It was strategically unsound to push onto the map. You should have allowed our upgrades to complete and used the high templar as drop defense.
What do you know?! You don’t even play protoss!
Reva places her index finger on Stunt’s forehead, easily keeping him at arm’s length.
The pair quiets their harmless squabbling when Jett rises.
That’s enough for today.
Eh? But it’s barely six o’clock.
The day before an important match is the most important. Not in terms of practice, but to prepare mentally.
Jett says so to no one in particular, making it a point to ignore me when I turn to look at her.
A new age method, huh? Better than the all-night cram sessions from the Brood War days, I suppose.
It’s scientifically proven to work. Besides, it’s not like I’m giving her the rest of the day to do as she pleases.
Damn. With Jett, even relaxation is ordained.
C'mon. We’re going to Namdan.
Again with Namdan? Pro-gamers don’t belong in a place without computers.
Would you rather spend the rest of the day cleaning ashtrays at your mom's?
You know what! You’re all just jealous that you don’t have a PC bang in the family!
The rest of us share a laugh on the way out with Stunt trailing after us begrudgingly.
Practice with Reva
Look for another protoss
Something else
Given the mood coming out of the cafe, I’m surprised to find that none of us have all that much to say as we loiter around a park bench.
Stunt’s attention never strays from the game on his phone, while Reva and Accel simply stare off into space.
Jett paces back and forth, though her gait lacks its usual purpose. Between all five of us, silence.
Maybe not all that much needs to be said. We all know the stakes. Everyone’s done their part to prepare for tomorrow.
It’s natural for us to feel nervous. The key is to keep it from affecting our chance of winning.
It is sad.
I shift my gaze towards Reva, surprised to find her staring at the ground.
What is?
This may be the last evening we gather as a team.
Ehh, c'mon Reva. Don’t say stuff like that. It won't do us any good.
But it is the truth.
Mach, please win tomorrow. I do not want to stop spending time with all of you.
I have been a happier person since I joined this team. I would strongly prefer to stay that way.
Guarded as she is, Reva intones a sadness that the rest of us are trying to deny. Even Jett ceases her march to observe the exchange.
I feel the same way, Reva. I’ll win tomorrow, I promise.
The penalty for lying is death.
Reva breathes out a sigh and collects herself.
I believe that you will.
Me too. Mach probably plays an important part of my story to become the greatest player of all time.
The first chapter can’t end with a loss. It just wouldn’t make sense.
An arm slings itself around my shoulder. With a glance, I find that it belongs to Accel.
Feeling alright?
Not as bad as before, but the pressure is still there.
As your coach, I am obligated to encourage you to win. But what’s most important is what you want.
For what it’s worth, I’m with Reva. I’d be sad to see you leave Korea.
I’ve got more than enough motivation for tomorrow. Is that what we’re here for?
It isn’t just for you.
For the first time first since she barged into my room, Jett addresses me directly. Her expression is devoid of the intensity that I’ve come to know her for.
I wasn’t lying when I said that you had the potential to be great. True as that is, it doesn’t make you special.
Everyone has the capability to be a champion. It isn’t genetic or unique.
I’m not denying the existence of talent. But it's not nearly as essential as people make it out to be. StarCraft—and everything else—is about way more than that.
Most people are either unwilling or unable to work hard. Simply being able to overcome that barrier makes it possible to do things that other people sit around and daydream about.
If you've done that, you can lose without regrets. Have you?
Yeah. I have.
Good. Then all that's left is to trust it'll earn us the win.
Silence follows Jett’s final remarks, leaving us with an air of gravitas. It’s only a quip from Stunt that saves the rest of us from our glum-faced staredown.
Deep.
Don’t be a prick, Stunt.
Alright. Let’s go over the game plan for tomorrow.
How you play is up to you. But it's probably smart to stick to what you've been practicing.
Yeah. I know better than to invent a build on the fly.
How about you open us up, Jett? Still against the build Reva prepared for game one?
I understand the idea, I just don’t think it’s a sure win. Bolt will probably assume Mach is looking to steal a win, so he’ll be on the lookout for something non-standard.
It was devised with that in mind. If executed as planned, it should secure a lead, if not a victory.
Don’t give Bolt any respect that he hasn’t earned. If you let him set the pace for the series, it'll be an uphill battle.
I agree with that, actually.
Alright, fine. It's just not my style of play.
 Moving on, how about mid-game?
Um, I was planning on my usual style. Dropships to establish map control and slow down his third base. If I scout that he’s being too greedy, I go for the kill.
That’s solid. I wouldn’t change anything there.
Seconded. It’s annoying playing against those kind of terrans if I can't kill them early.
Reva fidgets with her glasses, evidently disagreeing.
Do not write off the possibility of mech.
She's barely practiced mech! Why would you even suggest that?
It is the ideal unit composition when played at its apex.
Only if she can get there safely, which’ll be practically impossible against a protoss as lethal as Bolt.
Reva concedes her suggestion with a shrug.
Last thing. Late game. If Bolt manages to get on three bases, don’t try to end the game in a direct fight unless you have tons of defenses prepared to slow down his march.
The fully-powered protoss army is stronger than a maxed out terran, so you have to look elsewhere to find an edge.
The opposite is true in Brood War, so he's used to being the aggressor. If you see Bolt eager to engage with you, don’t automatically assume it's because he'll roll you.
That reminds me. Are there any other kind of mistakes that Brood War players make when they first switch to StarCraft 2? You and Accel should know better than anyone.
Hm. It’s the little things, honestly. Knowledge that you take for granted that Bolt has to work for.
You can look at five marauders and know they’ll crush seven stalkers without actively thinking about it, for example. He probably can’t yet.
That, and his strategies. Bolt hasn't been playing Star2 for as long as you, so he's probably only up to date on standard builds from the current meta.
He’ll be relying on game sense and mechanics to carry him through that shortcoming. If you can get a read on him, he won't be able to fall back onto an older style.
And as strong a Brood War player as he is, Bolt isn’t immune to slip-ups, especially in a new game. If he expands too fast or spreads his army too thin, crush him.
Yeah. Got it.
Then I guess we’ve done everything we can. Nothing to do but play.
You’ll want to run through some warm-ups and get a glimpse of the crowd early to keep your nerves down, so don’t be late.
When I answer with a nod, Accel smiles.
A final glimpse at the four faces of my teammates underscores the need to win tomorrow. Nothing else needs to be said. Everyone has placed not only their trust, but also their futures in me.
Failure is not an option.
I won’t be in this apartment for much longer.
But I'm going to leave it on my own terms.
How are you feeling, Mach?
Eh?
I blink my eyes and rub them awake. An hour of warm-up at the studio has left me with only fifteen minutes before the match is set to begin.
The foundation on my face isn't a kind I've used before and feels a bit weird. Standard procedure for all broadcasted matches, or so the makeup artist said as she applied it.
Behind Mr. Kim, a small crowd filters into the stage area. The semi-finals for the Victory StarLeague begins right after the showmatch, so it’s unlikely that everyone is here just to watch me and Bolt play.
But judging by the number of people sporting the black and white colors of Shock T1, there are at least a few.
Oh, Mr. Kim. Sorry. I’m well.
Good. Best of luck in your match. Let’s hope that this is the beginning of a long and fruitful partnership.
I lower my head in a curt bow.
I appreciate it.
Mr. Kim matches my bow with a nod, and then slips around the corner and into the studio.
I’m allowed only a minute of time to myself before the businessman's presence is replaced by Accel's.
Ready?
Yeah. I’m ready.
And I am. I stretch out my wrists and crack my knuckles to emphasize it.
Good. Let’s go.
... But before we get into that, we have a special match before the VSTL begins, don’t we?
That’s right. Most of you have likely heard the news that Accel and Jett have left their teams to begin their own.
Regardless of how the fans feel, one must admit that it was quite an ambitious decision.
Certainly! But today we have a match to decide whether those two will have their risk pay off!
A generous prize from Enoch Group has allowed us to host a showmatch between two wildly different players.
A new sponsor! How exciting. On top of that, it’s refreshing to see that KPGA has finally begun to embrace StarCraft 2. How much do we know about the protoss Bolt?
Ah, he’s a very strong player from Shock T1. But this is his first appearance in a StarCraft 2 match, isn’t that right?
We’ll have to see how his Brood War skills translate!
What about his opponent, Mach? Do we know much about her?
There was very little information available about her online, so we must assume that she is an amateur. All the same, she must be quite skilled for Jett and Accel to call her their teammate.
It dawns on me that this match is probably being broadcasted online. Should I have told my parents or friends to tune in and watch?
… No. Enough.
I’m tired of obsessing over acceptance from everyone from back home. This has nothing to do with them.
Now, let’s get the comments from our players. Please welcome, Bolt and Mach!
A production assistant gestures me forward, and I step out onto the stage. Bolt approaches from the other side, standing just a few feet from me when we come to a stop.
He gives a wave, and a few dozen people erupt into cheers. Among them are the screams of at least ten fangirls.
With a microphone in hand, he address the crowd with a charming disposition, completely opposite from every interaction I’ve shared with him.
First, I would like to thank my fans for coming today. I've worked hard to prove that KPGA players will place first in StarCraft 2 championships in the near future.
I’ve always performed well under pressure throughout my pro-gaming career, but today I don't think that I have much to worry about.
The comment draws a few laughs from the audience, KPGA fans and not. He continues.
I am confident that I'll only drop one map today. My opponent's year of StarCraft 2 must have earned her at least one win against my single week.
That’s just an outright lie. But judging by crowd’s reaction, they’re buying it completely.
Foreigners could never compete in Brood War. I'm here to prove that the same is true in StarCraft 2.
I promise to show you all good games. Please cheer for me!
He lifts a fist to another uproar of applause. What a fake piece of shit.
But before I can spend anymore time lingering on how much I dislike Bolt, the VSL hostess takes the mic from him and offers it to me.
Say a few words to your fans. I was told you can speak Korean, correct?
Before I know it, the microphone is in my hand. I try my best not to look bewildered and turn my attention to the audience.
Ehm. Hello. I’m Mach. I want to thank my team for helping me prepare for today's match, and the Enoch Group for sponsoring the showmatch.
I will do my best to win. Thank you.
My earnest approach earns me a polite response from the crowd, though not one that comes close to matching Bolt's.
Please shake hands and go to your booths.
Bolt is first to turn. His smile, no doubt designed and manufactured in an underground KPGA laboratory, belies the edge I see in his eyes.
He offers his hand, and I reach forward to take it for a single shake.
I hope you practiced hard.I am going to destroy you.
I did, don't worry.Not likely. I really, really want to see you lose.
That's good. It would be a shame to disappoint the fans with an uneven series.It doesn't matter what you want. You're trash, and after this you'll never forget it.
Agreed. Let's make sure to show exciting games.Easy to say. Let's see if you can actually do it.
We separate without incident and I turn to take my place in the booth.
Jett stands outside the door with my keyboard, mouse, and mousepad in hand.
What the hell is this?
She drops a keycap into my hand.
Um… I think that’s my Windows key?
It doesn’t belong on a pro-gamer’s keyboard. Fat-fingering that during a battle will tab you out and lose you the game.
She huffs and breaks eye contact. It’s obvious that she’s at least as stressed as I am.
Jett. I’ve got this.
I know. Do your best, Mach. Fighting.
With a nod, she pushes open the booth door.
Once inside, the ambient sound of the stage lights, cameras, and screens die down. All that I can hear is the subtle hum of the crowd and my own pulse.
It would be peaceful, if not for the adrenaline burning through my veins.
This is my first time inside of a booth. My heart is racing, and nothing I try to tell myself as I plug in my peripherals and configure my settings helps to calm it.
Playing in front of a crowd in the VSL has been a goal of mine for more than a year. Even with how hard I've been working, it feels like there should have been more build up to this moment.
Yet, here I am. I reach out to touch the soundproofing material, if only to allow another of my senses to confirm that the moment is real.
Even as I try to keep my focus away from the crowd and on the game, I keep glancing past the computer monitor and towards my teammates seated in the front row.
They wave and cheer at me as the studio lights dim. I force myself to look back at the PC and focus entirely on the match at hand.
Everything I’ve done over the past week… No. The months I’ve been in Korea, and even the time before that. It’s all lead up to this moment.
The second the loading screen ends, I put the plan into action. I rush one of my starting SCVs across the map.
But I'm not sending it to his base.
It comes to a stop on the outskirts of his fourth base location. It's only barely closer to his base than mine, honestly.
But it's close enough to buy me precious seconds.
Reva called this build 'Proxy Everything.'
Depot. Gas. Rax. Reactor. Fac. Starport. I've drilled it to perfection and hit every timing within the second.
Bolt didn't even scout. He'll pay for that mistake.
My dropship rushes straight into his base at a timing that normally wouldn't be possible. Every single one of those extra seconds is precious.
Perfect! I unload my hellions straight into his mineral line. He was completely unprepared!
He tries to escape with his workers, but I'm too quick in giving chase. I'm not letting you get away, Bolt.
My hellions weave past his slow-moving army and deal another blow to his economy. That one must have crippled him.
He remains in the game only as an act of defiance. With my victory assured, I march into his base with an overwhelming force and take a fight on his turf.
Tch. He scrapes together a final defense and actually manages to dent my army, though it's not enough to swing the game back.
Not bad. But game one is mine.
A gentle knock at the door behind me catches my attention while the studio prepares for the next game. A moment later, the door slides open.
Just as planned. Well executed, Mach.
Seriously, where did you of all people come up with a build like that?
Just because I loathe cheese does not mean I will not admit that it is occasionally useful and appropriate.
I guarantee we'll be seeing it on the ladder for the next month.
With luck, they will call it the Mach Build.
Maintain your momentum. Fighting.
She hurries out of the booth and back to her seat in the crowd when I nod. Just as before, the studio lights dim and the second match gets under way.
Phew. Okay, keep it cool. The momentum is in my favor now. I should make use of this breathing room.
I need to find out how Bolt's going to be playing for the rest of the set. He went for a standard expansion last game, but I wasn't able to see his army as intended.
This map is good for two-base play. I should definitely go for drops, but I still need to decide on an opening.
Woah, wait a second! Bolt is proxy-gating me!
God dammit, I didn't even consider the possibilty! I veer my gameplan in a defensive direction, but Bolt's attack is already overwhelming my mineral line.
Even with all the practice I had against Stunt's rushes, there's nothing I can do when caught so offguard. For every step forward I take with SCV and marine micro, Bolt seizes five with damage to my economy.
I can't stay in the game any longer and tap out a gg. Urgh! Just like that, he evened up the series!
I barely have time to take my headphones off before I feel a pair of hands clamp down on my shoulders.
Keep it up!
 Stay in the zone!
 You got this!
Ow. Ow! Okay, enough.
He got really lucky. Scouted your base first, and you only barely missed the probe as it came up your ramp.
C'mon, you've been practicing with the future protoss bonjwa and his macro-battery. The next game is yours for the taking.
Yeah. There's no way I'm letting another proxy get by me.
That's what I'm talking about! FIGHTING!
Alright. Keep it together. There's no way I'll let another proxy get by me.
My scout reveals little information, save that he's going for a one-base tech build. There are several things I need to be prepared for, so I should make sure the front of my base is reinforced.
As long as I keep my army on the ramp, I should be able to respond to any flying units. With each second that ticks by, I pull more and more away with the game.
Just as long as I don't tech too aggressively and focus on maintaining a sizable army, I should be fine.
Huh, did he transition into something more standard? He takes some damage on a scouting stalker before hastily pulling it away.
Was that it? I should probably double check whether or not he's got an expansion down. It might be a good call to throw down a missile turret in my main as well, just as a precaution.
Blink stalkers! Shit, he had vision on my high ground?! Must have been an observer... Argh! Why didn't I see it?!
He's able to pick off several units just as they finish building at my barracks, the numbers advantage heavily on his side.
I empty my bunkers and rush them up my ramp, but he turns my own choke point against me and handily defeats my entire army with some ridiculously precise micro.
I have nothing left to do but gg and accept the fact that I'm now down a game.
Knock knock.
Yo. How are you feeling?
Do you want the polite answer or the honest answer?
You're playing well, but Bolt's been able to sniff out where you're weakest. You need to confront him head-on.
A macro game with a KPGA pro? Is that smart?
Hey, no one ever said that StarCraft was an easy game.
We practice long hours for the moments like this. Show the crowd how hard you've been working.
... Alright. I won't go down without a fight.
Good. Fighting.
There's no way I'm giving up now. I've already proven to myself that I can beat this guy.
Forget the score. Focus on the game.
This map is huge, but I opt for a conservative timing on my expansion. Bolt's shown a serious proclivity towards aggressive play.
My scout reveals that we're on equal footing. Alright, time to drop the hammer.
My first drop manages to catch him with his army out of position. Perfect.
He has to be rushing back to defend against this drop. With that knowledge, I rush a second, smaller force into his third base.
Tch, he held firm! The second prong of my attack slams right into an overwhelming force. It's too late for me to pull away.
Agh, that wasn't his entire army?! The damage I managed to inflict wasn't nearly worth the cost of those two forces...
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.
I still have a decent army, I just need to contest the center of the map. I can't let him take another base.
ARGH! But he's already beat me to the punch! We clash briefly before I order a retreat, frantically reinforcing my wounded army.
I can't fall behind. Take more bases, keep my production going!
C'mon! I've got to deal some damage. If I just sit here and let him power up, he's going to roll me!
Boom! Stalkers! This kind of pick-off is just what I needed!
Shit, he's preparing an assault on my main! Pull back, pull back! I can defend this!
Just before his forces arrive, I get in position at the top of my ramp. It's looking even for a while, until...
Boom! HAH! This is the type of error a Brood War player makes! The burden to attack was mine, not his.
This game's tempo is back in my favor, even if I'm still at an economic disadvantage. I need to hit while he's still rebuilding.
Gotcha! The mineral line I failed to take down with my previous drop now lies in tatters.
And this time, my two-pronged attack catches a weak flank defending his third base! I'm pulling him apart!
I'm inflicting crushing economic damage. All I need to do is win one more fight.
I'm spending my minerals and gas the second I mine it. My production has been on point all game long.
There's absolutely no way this would have been possible without drilling for so many hours.
One more fight. Just one more fight! I march across the map and then charge up the ramp at his natural expansion.
I maneuver out of the way out his psi storms and pound the powerful, expensive units at the back of his army. With them all out of the way, I'm able to power through the rest of his force.
Yes! He types out a GG when I punch my way into his main base. The series is even!
My hands shake. The veins in my neck throb. My palms are covered with sweat.
My throat is dry. My eyes hurt. And I can't stop bouncing my leg.
Will you calm down? Sheesh.
I don't think that's going to be possible.
Tch. Typical amateur jitters. Don't try to ignore that adrenaline you're feeling—use it to your advantage.
What else do you want me to say? You already know what to do.
I don't know. Honestly, I didn't give any thought to how I'd feel if I made it this far. I kinda feel like throwing up, actually.
In that case, just imagine how sick you'll be when you win this thing.
In more ways than one.
Alright, enough chit-chat. Get serious, Mach.
Fighting.
Stay calm. Just one more.
Cross off that checklist. Depots. Rax. Expand.
A stalker denies my scout at the front of his natural expansion. Tch, that's frustrating.
Without knowing the timing on his second base, it's unsure of how much damage I need to do. When my dropships come out, I need to find a good angle to attack him from. Let's see...
... Woah. What? Six gates and a robo this early? How is that possible? That literally isn't possible.
But I'm forced to witness the reality of the situation march across the map. His army is ridiculously huge.
This is insane. He faked an expansion and intentionally delayed his one-base attack to catch me offguard.
I... simply do not have enough units to defend against his army. I won't for another minute, either.
By then, the game will be over.
I'm going to lose.
No! I don't need to take a direct engagement to win against Bolt!
It's time for a base trade.
With my entire army loaded in four dropships, I sprint across the map and unload into his base.
Bolt has two options. One: Pull back his army and suffer serious damage in the meantime or, two, rush into my base and do the same as I'm doing to him.
He opts for number two. Alright. I've been in these kind of situations before. This kind of game is far less about macro, micro, or anything like that. It's all about staying calm and making the right decisions.
I'm okay. His army is big, but mine is fast. I just need to focus on hunting his buildings down.
We trade building for building, the remnants of my main base unable to get away from his massive force.
Found another pylon! If I keep this up, I can put him in an unwinnable situation.
All he has left is a single pylon, the one he used to reinforce his attack.
Just before my final building bursts in the flames, I throw down a supply depot in a corner of the map guarded by terrain and distance.
If he wants to win, he'll have to abandon his final pylon. It's looking like this game might end up as a draw.
I'm about to ask if he wants the tie when I notice something in the corner of my eye.
.... WOAH. He just pulled a significant part of his army away from his pylon! He's destroying the rock barrier!
Shit! SHIT! I'm not in position to defend my final building! Not like this, god!
I have to beat him to it. Go. GO!
All is slow and silent. My heart thunders against my ribcage. I can feel the blood roaring through my veins.
A second later, I rip my headphones off and scream in triumph. 
This high... I’ve never felt anything like it. All the effort and hardship I’ve poured into the twenty years of my life. This one moment is worth it all.
With a thump, Jett bursts through the booth's door and pounds my back with claps between her own cheers.
She’s soon joined by the rest of my team who follow suit, sharing in my victory.
No, not my victory. Our victory.
With some prodding from Accel, we collect ourselves and step out onto the stage to show our gratitude to the crowd with waves and smiles.
But before the VSL hostess can cross the stage for a post-game interview, Bolt emerges from his booth with a macabre expression splattered across his face.
He wrenches the microphone from the hostess' hand and points at me from the other side of the stage.
Savor that win, you piece of shit. It’s the last you’ll ever have against me.
The crowd reacts with a mixture of astonishment and encouragement, the latter coming mainly from the fans dressed in Shock T1’s black and white.
Emboldened by my failure to respond, he continues.
The current StarCraft 2 pro-gamers pool disgraces eSports. I pledge to my fans that I will expose these frauds for what they are.
I hereby announce my retirement from Brood War.
I am immediately going full-time with StarCraft 2 with the intent to take the VSL Championship on behalf of those that deserve the honor of calling themselves professional gamers.
With that, Bolt slams the microphone against the ground, causing its plastic shell to fracture and a loud screech to emit from the speakers.
He stalks off stage and through the players’ exit without another word, trailed by the stares of his fans.
Woah. There’s no way that was a part of the KPGA’s plan.
That guy really likes to break electronics, huh? I wonder how many keyboards he’s been through.
I share a baffled look with Jett before the VSL hostess picks up what remains of the microphone and steps to my side. My teammates take it as a cue to vacate the stage.
The post-game interview is short and formal, with half of the crowd completely unresponsive to my attempt to show good sportsmanship.
Either they’re on Bolt's side, or they're impatient to see the VSTL get started.
Still, a handful of people cheer me off the stage as the studio begins to set up for team league. 
Among them is a familiar wisp of grey hair. But when I search for the face to whom it belongs, I don't see who I'm looking for.
To my utter surprise, a trio of foreigners approach backstage with autograph requests. I oblige them nervously, unfamiliar with how to properly sign the mousepads they hand me.
Thanks!
Yeah, thanks!
You rock!
I scratch behind my head when they head off, surprised and humbled.
Not a bad start, Mach.
I turn to find Jett watching me from across the room. She pushes off the wall and ambles toward me.
And. Uh. For the record, I’m sorry that I hit you.
It might have been what I needed. There’s no hard feelings.
It wasn't right. There was probably a better option.
It’s in the past. Seriously.
She smiles genuinely, far wider than I've ever seen from her before.
You’ll make a good teammate.
A sudden clap purges the expression from her face. Just like that, it’s back to the intense Jett that I’m much better acquainted with.
Alright, enough backpatting. Back to the team, we’ve got places to be.
Without bothering to answer my curious look, she rolls her wrist in a beckoning motion and leads me out into the hallway of the VSL studio.
It’s crowded, with even more people pouring into the studio in anticipation of the semi-final team league match.
But off away from the foot traffic, we find Mr. Kim with Accel, Stunt and Reva.
He turns to regard Jett and then me with a smile, restrained in comparison to my teammates.
And the victor arrives. Congratulations, Mach.
I lower my head in a bow without taking my eyes off of him.
Thank you.
I’ll send word for my assistant to publish a press release. The sponsorship should be no surprise given how quickly this type of information spreads, but it should be a nice PR boost for Enoch Red.
... Alright, I’ll admit. That’s a pretty good name.
Mm. I’ll leave the rest to Jett. I expect great things from you five.
When Mr. Kim turns to leave, Reva, Stunt and I probe Jett with looks.
The rest?
It’ll be easier for me to show than to explain. C’mon, it’s not far.
I fall in line behind Stunt and Accel after Jett takes off, stepping in time with Reva at my side. She leans towards me with an offered smile.
Congratulations. You avoided the death penalty.
Yeah. Now instead of dying an instant death, I die a slow one at the hands of a Korean practice regimen.
Oh. In that case, it is not too late.
She gently chops the back of my neck. I feign decapitation and then straighten back up to meet her smile.
... This one.
She tests the key against the lock only to find that it doesn’t fit.
No, wait. This one.
We retrace our steps back down the apartment building’s hallway to a door we passed earlier. She tries the key and, again, it doesn't fit.
Are we on the wrong floor?
No! Will you just... Wait. Oh, it's the one across the hall.
This time, the key slides into the lock and then turns, revealing a mostly unfurnished room.
It’s small, and it’s not in a great part of town. But I can’t deny the pride welling up inside of me as I step inside, shoulder to shoulder with my teammates.
We spread out instinctively, looking over the plain floors and countertops as if we were inspecting a mansion.
How'd you get this so quickly?
It was a good deal, but they wanted the deposit more than a week ago. Someone else was trying to snatch it out from under us.
You put money down on our team house without knowing whether or not I’d win against Bolt?
Jett dodges the question by glancing away, leaving Accel to swoop in and fill the silence.
Nice having a team that believes in you, eh? That’s not all, by the way.
He gestures towards a lonely cardboard box off in the corner of the room.
Stunt, I think you should have the honor.
Somehow, Stunt has found the time during this monumental occasion to pull out his phone.
But, as instructed, he makes his way to the corner of the room and peels back the box’s lid.
What follows is a sound of unbridled joy.
HEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL YEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
He rummages around in the box’s contents before pulling free a red and white jacket.
One by one, Stunt practically rips them free and tosses them towards the four of us.
I catch mine and, on closer inspection, find the Enoch Red logo on the back.
Jett’s expression is too neutral to be authentic. I think it’s simply that she has a hard time admitting that she had faith all along.
Knowing that makes me happy, so I have no reason to press her on it.
YO! IT’S TIME TO CELEBRATE!
You got your chance to celebrate a week ago! Now is time to practice.
Oh how easily Jett breaks herself out of her quiet trance when the chance to play empress arrives.
Pft, how? There’s like two PCs here! C’mon, last time before we’re VSL champs. I swear.
I'm with the kid.
I concur.
C’mon, Jett. One last time.
Accel, you’re supposed to be on my side. And the rest of you are too willful. I’ll break you of it eventually.
One. Last. Time.
Stunt takes the opportunity to throw on his team jacket and sprint into the hallway, the rest of us quick to follow suit.
It's cold. The coldest it’s been since I came to Seoul.
But I don’t feel it. I’m warmed by my newfound confidence. By the camaraderie I’ve forged with my teammates.
This is everything I have ever wanted. A team, friends, and a goal to work towards.
When I take a step back, it seems silly. It’s nothing I could explain to a random person on the street.
I beat someone at a video game, I’ve earned a free bunk bed in a tiny apartment, and I’m obligated to work for more than ten hours a day.
But I can say with certainty—with the knowledge that I’ve given it my all:
We’re all going to make it.
Grab a quick expansion.
Lean on him with some early pressure.
Feint an aggressive strategy.

SC2VN is a visual novel about StarCraft in South Korea and the people who play it.
If you are new to eSports or StarCraft, you can watch a short, voice-acted scene that will introduce you to professional StarCraft.
Or, you can watch the scene later in the extras menu and get right into the action.
In SC2VN, you select the gender of the main character, Mach.
The choice will mostly impact how he or she appears. The story differences are minor.
Now, select the main character.
Begin the story as the female main character?
Begin the story as the male main character?
.... Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Hey Timmy! Long time no see. How's it going?
Oh, hey Day9... Not too good.
Aww, why so glum dude? What's up?
Well, I wanna play this super neat new game, it's called SC2VN. But I don't know that much about StarCraft. I'm afraid a bunch of stuff is just going to go over my head.
Aww, don't get down on yourself Timmy. How about I help you out on some background info? That way, you won't feel so lost.
Wow, really...? Thanks Day9, you're the best!
No problem Timmy! So, what would you like to know?
Okay, well, what were the earliest days of StarCraft like in Korea?
Oh you mean the days when players dressed up in spacesuits and played in tiny studios with fog machines?
Aaaaww that sounds sooooo cooooool...!
Okay hold on, we're getting a little ahead of ourselves. Don't you need me to tell you what StarCraft actually is?
Please Day9, I'm not that bad. What kind of person downloads visual novels about StarCraft without knowing that it’s a popular real time strategy game made by Blizzard?
Well Timmy, in the off-chance that this is a recording designed for complete newbies to eavesdrop upon, how about I go over a few basics?
Guhhh, fine.....
Like you said Timmy, StarCraft is a highly competitive game. Rather than the black and white of chess pieces, players choose between three different races, each with its own advantages and playstyles.
The powerful, enigmatic protoss. The scrappy, efficient terran. Or the swarmy, insect-like zerg. For fifteen years StarCraft has been played professionally in South Korea.
Wow, really? You mean... people can play video games for a living?
That’s right Timmy! Corporate sponsors fund teams for millions of dollars just like any other sport, and the players compete in televised tournaments for cash prizes in events known as StarLeagues. eSports is the real deal!
And people actually tune into the tournaments? They watch StarCraft on TV?
I can't believe it!
Believe it, Timmy! Those television broadcasts helped expose StarCraft to non-gamers, and fans began to follow eSports not only because they played the game themselves, but because they could get invested in the players, personalities, rivalries, the storylines!
I guess that makes sense. So, eSports became popular in Korea in the early 2000s... But what was happening everywhere else in the world?
Well StarCraft was certainly successful in the West, with a ton of great competitors existing from all over the world.
But, StarCraft didn't really catch on as a televised eSport anywhere else.
So as a result, the Korean players, with their professional training and their televised tournaments were head and shoulders above everyone else.
Well okay, the Koreans were better in Starcraft 1 (Brood War). But wasn't everyone on an even playing field when StarCraft 2 came out?
Well at first yeah, but you have to remember that Korea already had an infrastructure for televised eSports. They simply rolled that same regimented practice schedule over to StarCraft 2.
And even though everyone started the same, quickly, Korea left the rest of the world in the dust.
Only a handful of non-Korean players have been able to put up a challenge. Nothing really compares to the Korean team house.
What's a team house?
C'mon Timmy, you can figure this one out.
Uhhhhhnnmmmmm?????
A for effort Timmy! It's pretty much what it sounds like. A team house is both living quarters and a practice environment.
Coaches and managers add structure to a daily schedule, they match you up against practice partners in a way that's more productive to you. And because everyone lives together...
... they're talking strategy all the time. It's pretty much unanimously agreed upon that Korea is the place to be to get better at StarCraft.
As a result, western pros head abroad to train or bootcamp pretty regularly.
Wow. I feel so enlightened! All of this knowledge......!
Thrilled to be of service Timmy. Anything else I can assist with?
Yeah I think covers everything Mr. Nine. Now I can read SC2VN without googling every five minutes! Thanks for helping me out. I super, duper appreciate it.
Totally.
Anyways, I'll see you later! Thanks again!
Good luck Timmy! And try not to get a bad ending!
Can you believe this? Relegated to a scene in the extras… I didn’t back the project for this!
Calm down. We got a cameo in the main game, didn't we?
FOR LIKE LITERALLY TWO SECONDS. I wanted them to go deep into my life and backstory! What makes me tick? What’s my motivation?!
So this is going to be one of those extra scenes… Well let’s make the most of it. What’s the story excuse for us to be here anyway?
We won a contest hosted by the VSL. It includes an all-expenses paid trip to the VSL Finals and a voucher for a free day at a hot spring just outside of Seoul.
Wait, give me that. That kind of pandering isn’t in the budget. Besides, this isn’t an otome game.
Five out of the seven characters are male, not including us or Mach. Are you sure about that?
Well, it’s certainly not a BL game. And that’s a decent ratio for eSports!
Reva isn’t brave enough to go outdoors unless it’s for StarCraft, which leaves us with Jett for OVA-style hijinks...
We would die for sure.
According to canon sources, she can throw a shot glass at 85 mph.
That’s before the hydralisk range buff, too. Dangerous. Very dangerous. Attempting a run-by would be a mistake.
Fine then, no hot springs. How are we going to spend our time then?
There’s plenty of things we can do! We can go to Seoul Tower, on a hike, to a k-pop concert… What’s with that look?
The budget. We can only go to places that are in the main story.
Agh! Those cheapskates! Forget StarCraft, this is the actual ded gaem!
Would you rather them have cut your expressions and poses down to pay for us to sightsee?
Hm. Good point. I value my emotions.
Then c’mon. Let’s go find something to do.
The Golden Zonefire lounge. Do PC bangs typically have lounge areas?
I don’t think so. But it would be too repetitive to show only the area with computers, don’t you think?
Also, the keyboard sounds get annoying after so long. I think sacrificing realism was a good trade off.
It says here that the team was originally supposed to hang out at a coffee shop.
Pft. Hipsters.
A PC bang lounge is more fitting for a bunch of pro-gamers. But they won’t get to spend much time here in the future since they’ll be slaves of Jett’s team house.
The sequel will be very exciting. It will feature 20,000 StarCraft scenes, a dishwashing minigame, and a single match in the VSL round of 32. Try to avoid the wrist surgery bad ending.
Please don’t get people’s hopes up like that…
What, don’t tell me that there won’t be a sequel?! #BrokenPromises!
It is probably too early to tell without knowing the reception. It also depends on whether or not the game goes on Steam.
Oh. That explains the picture of the Pudge.
Wait one moment. Do you see that object on the table there?
A reminder that cigarettes exist! No! Now the game is going to be rated T for terrible, terrible influences.
Well, it can’t be helped. There’s not much else to be said of this place, so let’s continue.
Before we go, there’s an anecdote here. Do you remember how Jett asked who Mach was by saying: ‘Name?’
That exact thing happened to the writer at the open bracket of a major tournament. I have a special note that says: ‘Caliber is an S rank bully, please unfollow him on Twitter.’
Brutal.
Hm. Where to next?
Wait, we can admire our surroundings a bit. Look at the Korean on the signs! Wow, amazing. I wonder who performed the incredible feat of coming up with the characters?
There is a high likelihood that one these signs has an error.
Ha. Ha. Well, you know…
And while we're on the topic of inaccuracies, Korean players are most often referred to by their real names instead of their handles as is typical in the Western scene.
That one was intentional! Please, the team tried their best...
Hey, would that coffee shop you mentioned have been Cafe Latte? I could go for drink right now. A shame that we can’t go inside.
Look up. It appears that *onster has its own building in Seoul. Perhaps you can try there?
Wow, the EG sponsorship really must have paid off! I wonder who runs the office?
Who knows? Well, let’s go take a look at Stomping Grounds. We’ve been away from computers for too long as is.
Gaming addiction is a very serious problem in South Korea. Be careful with those jokes, unless you want to undergo shock therapy.
Ooh, street food. Are you guys hungry?
That looks like a Tornado Potato. An intense food with a name to match.
It would not surprise me to learn of a pro-gamer with that as his handle.
If we’re going for realism, it would be more like TorNado_potAtO. Maybe one is the team name and the other is the handle.
There’s a pro-gamer who once had a tomato haircut. It was possibly the only hairstyle more gaudy than Stunt’s. Google it, I'm serious.
We will need to get a confirmation on that from StarCraft's official hair authority before passing judgment.
... Clearly, this background has weak material for jokes. We should escape it as soon as possible.
Stomping Grounds. Also known as the PC bang that Stunt’s mom runs. He’s the hero of the cafe until he’s defeated and captured by Mach.
Lucky for him that this isn’t a *ance game. Gahahaha!
Hero to a bunch of middle schoolers, at least. How old is Stunt anyway?
Sixteen. But that makes him fifteen by our standards. Korean age is slightly different.
... Hm… Something seems off.
What is it?
Why are they advertising for the VSL? If it was just a little poster I would understand, but that thing on the right covers the entire wall.
Oh. It says here that this was originally the background for the qualifier area. You know, the opening shot where Mach whines about losing?
But there was only one scene there, so they repurposed it to be a second PC bang.
What?! That’s lazy!
HEY! Don’t speak badly of my establishment!
Ah! S-Sorry, Mrs. Stunt…
Hm. Do you think that there's a Mr. Stunt?
If there is, he has a troubled relationship with his family. Maybe he’s always overseas, or maybe he’s just a deadbeat.
Oh, poor Stunt. No wonder why he’s such a twerp. No male role models.
He could have had it a lot worse on the female Mach route if this were a certain type of doujin.
... P-Please. This isn't one of those kind of games. Let's not go there.
Hm. I find this place is more aesthetically appealing than Golden Zonefire. Why couldn’t Stomping Grounds have been the main cafe?
Because then the game would be too dark. This story is about StarCraft, not Diablo.
You have a point…
In reality, most PC bangs have low light like this. It helps ease eye strain and makes it easier to hide from your parents when you haven’t returned home for four days.
When you say it so matter-of-factly, I get the impression that you know from experience.
Don’t haze me. We must save our efforts for the cast of the main story.
You’re right! We can’t bother with infighting when our spotlight is so brief. This scenario is already 40 percent done!
Good point. Who should we bully next?
Mr. Yeon’s store is pretty close…
Wait, what’s with the look?
We can’t antagonize an old man! We’ll show up on the news as an example of the negative influence that foreigners have in Korea.
Mr. Yeon lives a respectable, ascetic lifestyle. There’s no way that he has any regrets about working long past the age of retirement. He said so himself, so it must be true.
Ergh, now I feel bad. Please, to people that ship characters, leave Mr. Yeon alone. His life is hard enough already.
There’s another minor character we can bother. C'mon.
Hmm, what do you think it is that Enoch Group does?
The main story implies that Mr. Kim’s explanation is vague because he assumes that Mach is an idiot. While he does actually think that, Mr. Kim was also not being completely forthright.
Ehh, excuse me! You can’t just…!
Damn! He’s not here. Well, it makes it easier to talk behind his back at least. So, what are the details on Mr. Skinny-Tie?
Well, don’t you find it somewhat suspicious that he was trying to sponsor a team out of nowhere? And his wording at certain times too was particularly ominous.
Wait… Don’t tell me...
Yes, it’s true. Mr. Kim will pressure Jett to match fix.
That's a huge spoiler for the next game! You just ruined more sequel potential, you monster!
The hints were there, I merely pointed them out. It’s just a theory of mine, anyway…
What a bastard! Mr. Kim is killing eSports! Do you think that he’s the one that *KP got involved with?
The Kong is guilty until proven innocent, apparently.
Well, putting that aside. How do you think that Jett would react to the pressure?
She’s too honorable give up her dignity for a few bucks. She’d get a job at Enoch to help support the team before throwing matches! I guarantee it.
Hmm, businesswoman Jett. The concept is undeniably appealing.
Holding a clipboard, asking in a patient yet firm voice where the TPS reports are...
This is the ideal moment for more fanservice. Sadly, we must use our imaginations instead. A crushing moment of defeat for everyone involved.
We should escape this building before the Enoch secretary calls security on us.
That’s probably a good idea. Let’s go and and see Mach’s apartment.
People might get the wrong idea about our intentions, though.
Psh, it’s fine! There’s no jail background in this game, so we’re safe.
Isn’t it a little bit strange that both female and male Mach have the same kind of room?
Come on. There’s plenty to complain about when it comes to cut corners, but that’s a bit of a stretch. It’s not like there’s underwear lying on the floor or something.
Do a better job of hiding the disappointment in your voice next time.
Who do you think that picture is of in the bookshelf there?
Hm. It says here that it was a photo of Mach’s parents at one point, but that was before the relationship with them was changed in the script. Now, it’s a picture of Zyzz.
That seems less of a strangely fitting role model for a pro-gamer and more of something made up on the spot for the sake of a joke. 
... I’ll try not to judge too harshly.
Additionally, that poster in the background was supposed to be a generic kpop-styled poster. The producer had in mind a girl’s group, but instead they got a solo artist.
Ah, Mach. Such pedestrian tastes… I was hoping he’d appreciate a YG aesthetic.
Hold on, let’s skip ahead a bit.
How did you do that? And wait… The clock in the background didn’t change! It’s still 9:38.
Time must stand still in this room. It’s only the light from outside that changes.
This is the writer’s favorite background. A stark contrast from the PC bang which was the producer’s favorite.
 A dark and lonely room vs. a bright and social one, both as places to play StarCraft. The difference in personalities is clear.
It’s pretty small here, but considering the location it’s not so bad. Better than Reva’s goshiwon, at least.
What’s the deal with Reva, anyway? She's like the child of Rei and IdrA.
She grew up in a rural part of Korea with a computer as her only friend. She ranks as the poorest person on the team.
Oh, that’s sad. Perhaps we should avoid making jokes at her expense.
Reva is also the only person on the team who has a happy, stress free relationship with her parents. They support her pro-gamer goals fully, even though they don’t understand eSports.
Gah! Ignorant bumpkins and their love of their only child… All pro-gamers should share the story of Doublelift.
I don’t understand her obsession with mech though.
It’s a strategy that suits Reva’s personality quite well. She and Artosis should work together to defend the sanctity of tank lines and double armories.
Oh, will she also switch to a card game for children in the sequel?
Cruel… So cruel...
The entrance to Namdan Park is across the street on the left. Do you think that most people caught that on their own?
Maybe. From the park you can see Mach’s apartment building as well. Too bad that the VSL studio is too far away to see from here.
Wasn’t the actual GSL studio in on the top floor of a middle school at one point? Stunt should have a ton of fans show up to his matches!
Back already. This area is probably the one closest to a real location, that being the GSL studio before they moved to Gangnam.
Mm. The booth designs give it away, even if the lighting and logo is slightly different.
This is where all of the regular season games are played throughout the VSL. Around fifty people can fit comfortably in here.
There are four booths not because of a 2v2 league, but so that players can adjust their settings and set-up while a game is ongoing. Keeps things rolling or whatever.
Tch, but where are the casters! The crowd?! I’m all Ready to Roar!
Ready or Not!
Ready to Giv-- 
Hm, no. I will maintain my composure.
If the devs were brave, they’d have put the song in the game instead of some random alt. Cowards.
Please, the nostalgia pandering is already close to maximum.
At this rate, our scene will be far too opaque for the weebs who have been conned into reading this far and don’t know anything about StarCraft.
Those fans have our appreciation for sticking it out this long! Maybe we should do something to reward their patience?
What! They already got a scene with Day9! What a waste, if they don’t know StarCraft they wouldn’t even know who he is! Such a squandered opportunity. The devs should have conned him into saying some absolutely EPIC memes.
Woah, speak of the devil. Really laying your cards out on the table there, aren’t you Mr. Nine?
... And now we know what race his cat plays.
Uh. Where were we again?
Helping out the newbies. Let’s start with the term dishwasher. That sounds like a nonsense insult to an outsider, doesn’t it?
I’ve got this one! It’s simple. There are chores to be done in the team house which generally fall to the B-teamers. Calling someone a dishwasher is the same thing as calling them a benchwarmer.
What? They should just hire a housekeeper.
With what money?! 
Sorry, I channeled Jett there for a moment. Her VSL Champion status gives her a powerful aura in the studio.
It says here that there was originally supposed to be an attendant character to accompany Mr. Kim. She would ostensibly fulfill the role of housekeeper, but would actually be there to keep an eye on the team and report their actions back to Enoch.
That’s too bad. This game is a visual novel after all. It’s in desperate need of more women for lonely virgins to fawn over.
No projecting.
What! I’m just saying what everyone is already thinking. I mean, look at Bolt. That guy looks like he was constructed in a fujoshi’s workshop. I'd bet that Reva has lewds of him on her computer.
About as sure of a bet that Stunt ran home and looked up the photoshoot that Jett talked about at the bar.
You know, Bolt's history with Jett was briefly addressed in the main game, but there’s a lot that Mach never learns about.
They seem like they're cut from the same cloth. I’ll bet they had a rivalry in their middle school eSports club at the least.
Strange. The information on their relationship prior to the beginning of the game is all redacted.
Well, it says here that Jett asked a longtime friend of hers on Shock for some replays who then ratted on her to Bolt. That’s why he brought the thumb drive for Mach.
Damn, betrayed. Well, wait, she was technically the one that initiated the a betrayal so-- whatever. Mach won, so it didn’t matter.
You could originally choose whether or not to give the replays back. Hell, I’d have hung onto it just for the free flash drive. Bolt’s kind of a weird guy.
Well, he’s frustrated by the fact that Brood War is losing popularity, and he pushes that frustration onto StarCraft 2 and the people playing it.
How childish! What kind of miserable person would let their frustrations on the declining popularity of a video game affect those around them?
But he plays StarCraft 2 in secret at the beginning of the game, right? Why is that?
Probably because he was already thinking about jumping ship to SC2 and didn't want his team to know. Either that, or he found the game fun.
Wait. Bolt is starting to sound vaguely apologetic. He was a huge jerk to Mach! We’re supposed to hate him.
He’s really just another guy trying to make it in eSports. You’ve already seen how tough it is for Jett’s team. Imagine that, plus the fear that all the money in your game's scene will be gone soon.
Hm. And I bet it seemed pretty unfair that a bunch of foreign investment went to StarCraft 2 rather than the game that built up eSports as we know it.
Wow, I never thought about it like that. KeSP-- I MEAN, KPGA guys have it rough.
Should we expect a Vegeta style conversion at some point to unite against match fixing, then?
We’ve said too much as is. Let’s go see the team house before our time runs out.
People that see this apartment as humble are sadly mistaken. Team houses are not nearly this nice most of the time.
The tradeoff is in size. If the team recruits anymore players, people might mistake this place for a gold farming den.
I’ll bet that the fridge is stocked with Mach’s energy drinks. It’s very diligent of him to support the companies that sponsor eSports so selflessly.
What’s the layout for the team house anyway?
It says here that there’s two bedrooms. One for guys and one for girls.
Huh. I would have expected Jett to demand a room to herself. And it’s too bad that someone as laidback as Accel has to share a space with Stunt.
Maybe it’ll do the kid some good. Accel’s an old hand at this stuff.
It’s unfortunate that Accel is locked into that contract with Crash. He’d probably be the team’s best player.
Don’t get ahead of yourself. I have the power rankings right here.
Oh! Dish it out. Who’s the best?
The skill ranking is as follows: Jett > Accel > Reva > Mach > Stunt. However, Stunt has a high amount of potential to move up if he improves his mindset.
Damn. So if Bolt is Vegeta, then that means Jett is Goku?
Accel is Piccolo, Stunt is Gohan. Reva is an android. And, Mach… I’m sorry, but you’re Yamcha.
... Brutal. Couldn’t even give him Krillin.
We’re giving Tasteless a run for his money when it comes to references here.
Alright. How are we going to wrap this up, boys? Anything you want to say to the fans out there?
I have a direct message here from the devs, actually. It says: 'Thanks to our fans who waited patiently on release. We hoped that we showed you a good visual novel. Please support us in the future, fighting!'
I guess Mach really was just a self-insert for a Koreaboo all along.
Oh, and then at the bottom: ‘And a special thank you to all of our backers! The project would not have been possible without you.’
That’s us! We did it, guys! We saved eSports!
... Well, we saved SC2VN, at least.
That about does it for us then. It was a pleasure providing a poorly disguised developer commentary alongside you two.
Likewise.
Take care! Let’s meet again. Before StarCraft 3 comes out, please.
There’s a certain feeling that every StarCraft player gets before they lose.
Most try to ignore it at first, as if the inevitable is just another challenge to fight through.
Like their past mistakes don’t count if they just try a little bit harder.
It's a natural thing. To believe otherwise contradicts the hours we spend practicing.
Still, every player must eventually come to terms with a defeat.
That they have to queue up for another game, or maybe that they flew across the world for nothing.
I haven't met many players that can take a loss in stride.
It’s painful. It's permanent. It's proof that your best isn't always enough.
Long after my elimination, I remain at the PC with a blank look in my eye.
Clicks shoot from my finger as I leap from page to page. A tournament update mentions my defeat in passing, but no one acknowledges it.
When my frustration fades, I’m left only with guilt.
I should have practiced harder.
I consider sticking around to watch the final few games, but the knot in my stomach persuades me to avoid anymore stress.
People are nice enough to a foreigner with the heart to attempt a StarLeague qualifier.
But without a win, I’m just one more in a long line of losers.
Every game of StarCraft begins the same.
Gather resources.
Train a worker. 
Construct a building.
Rally an army.
Defend a base.
Contest the map.
Turn something small into something more.
This game is punishing. It’s stressful. It’s draining. It builds you up and tears you down.
It’s not for everyone. It might not even be for me.
How many more chances am I going to get? Was that my last?
Oh. The feeling is back.
Hah… Why am I still trying? Why can’t I quit?
My fist rattles the desk and sends a plastic bottle onto the floor. With my chin in hand, I throw myself into the match replay.
I force down a measured breath. Losing a throwaway ladder game shouldn't bother a player of my rank.
Scout denial and my poor control of the final fight gave my opponent the edge. In retrospect, my mistakes seem obvious.
I toy with the conclusion that he was hacking before realizing that I’m just making excuses. No, I should have been able to win that one.
Despite the Grandmaster badge next to my handle, I find myself too anxious to queue up for another game.
The loss at the Victory StarLeague qualifier earlier today isn't helping my mindset. I comb my tiny room with a look, restless and unmotivated.
Sitting alone in a dark room for extended periods of time is incredibly depressing, a fact I learned only when it became a significant part of my life.
Only one thing is certain. I’ve got to get out of here.
After double-checking that my apartment's door is locked, I hustle down the stairs and onto the sidewalk. Light grows with each step towards the shining skyline.
Catchy pop beats and posters of flawless models dominate street after street. Foot traffic is thick and impatient. Seoul Tower stands tall from a distant hilltop.
But even the lingering excitement of life in a faraway place can't dredge me out of my hopelessness.
Sometimes, especially on days like this, I regret pursuing eSports. It's a thought I've had more times than I'd care to admit since coming to South Korea.
Even saying that, I know that I can't keep myself from competing. It's in my nature. And truth be told, this damn game is the only thing I'm good at.
What is StarCraft? Some respond to that with an explanation on its game mechanics or its storyline.
There are other popular answers too. That it requires the dexterity of a pianist alongside the strategic thinking of a chess player.
Maybe that's what StarCraft is to most people. But to the hundreds who carve out a living on it, StarCraft isn't such a simple thing.
It's the embodiment of competition, a perfect playing field. No need for athletic genes, rabid parents, tutting tutors, or expensive summer camps.
You pick up the game on your own. You learn. You improve. You work. If you're good enough, you can become a god.
And if you fail, you stay a nobody.
I'm not building towards a long-term career. I'm friendless in a foreign country. I'm respected by no one.
And if I don’t qualify for the VSL next month, I’ll be back home at square one.
I'll be nothing.
... But hey, at least I play video games all day.
Are you completely sure you haven’t forgotten anything?
Do you have enough money for the cab when you land?
Are you sure that the apartment got your money?
Is your cell phone charged? You brought an extra charger, right?
Mom. I’m fine. Please, nothing bad is going to happen.
Remember. There won’t be anyone to do your laundry, cook your meals, or wake you up when you oversleep.
Budget well and you'll have two months. I won't hear anything about a loan for the flight home.
It takes effort to keep a frown from my face. I’m certain that my parents came to see me off only so that they could say they did.
I’ve already sunk the entirety of my savings into this. Now isn’t the time for second thoughts.
My dad gestures towards the security line and taps his watch twice.
Go on. The sooner this is over with the better.
Oh, come back in one piece, hun.
Nothing comes when I think of how to respond, so I only nod. Without another word, my parents walk away.
He has to make his own mistakes.
I tighten my fist, pace quickening. Even though I want to prove everyone who's doubted me wrong, I’m tired of losing for no one’s sake but my own.
With the sun long set, overhead signs wash the streets in color. I’ve wandered so far that a walk back to my apartment would take almost a half hour.
My renewed drive to practice my craft drives my search for a place to play. It’s not long before I see the words I’m looking for: PC bang.
The amount of foot traffic suggests it's a pretty popular internet cafe. A sign on the front window reads Golden Zonefire.
Though I've only visited them a few times, PC bangs are one of the things that interested me most about Korea when I first got into StarCraft.
Duking it out for champion status of a neighborhood cafe is old school cool. Like the type of Western where a sheriff defends his turf against upstarts and outlaws.
It's an ideal that's a little bit dated these days. Most StarCraft 2 competition takes place either online or in broadcast studios.
I'll admit, I’ve daydreamed of being born a decade earlier and playing the original eSport, Brood War, during its rise alongside the PC bang.
A better time. Or so they say online.
I trundle up the stairs and pass through the doorway, immediately struck by the size of the place. There has to be at least eighty computers.
The crowd is too large for an ordinary evening. There are more people than there are PCs, even.
I indulge my curiousity on the first person I see: A dark-haired guy observing a match of SC2 from behind someone’s shoulder.
Excuse me. Is there an event going on?
The guy turns and looks at me like I’m speaking something other than Korean. After a brief silence, he responds.
Are you new or something? How have you not heard of All-Out Attack?
Yeah, I am new. Just asking.
He hums and glances away for a moment. Though he doesn’t apologize, he does fill me in.
Golden Zonefire hosts a StarCraft 2 tournament called All-Out Attack once a month. It's one of the few places you'll find a decent player outside of an online cup or a StarLeague.
Used to be a Brood War tournament, actually.
I see. Thanks man. Who are you here to cheer for?
He only stares in response. The guy walks away with a shake of his head, mumbling something about foreigners.
The back of his shirt sports the Korean Pro-Gamer Association logo. Oh, he must be a Brood War fan.
None of the StarCraft teams under KPGA’s regulations compete in anything except the original game, Brood War. Understandably, they don't want to fracture a scene they've worked hard to build up.
And that’s lucky for those of us trying to keep from drowning in a game that’s already deep with talent. KPGA players train for unbelievable hours.
Well, I came here to practice, and now I’m presented with an excellent chance to do so if what that guy said is true.
A few stares follow me as I walk forward to put my name on the sign-up list. I must look like a tourist in over my head.
I’m definitely not the first foreigner to go abroad for eSports, but most come to South Korea only once they have results or fame.
After paying for an hour's worth of PC time at the front desk, I settle for a station that has a mouse and keyboard similar to my setup back home.
A few minutes later, I join my opponent’s game lobby just in time for the start of the first round.
His name isn't familiar, so I check his profile to see he’s ranked midway through master league. Not bad for a casual player.
He seems eager enough by the rate he's spamming 'gogo' in the pre-game chat. The game gets underway once I confirm that I'm ready.
As soon as the victory screen displays, anxiety floods out of my body.
StarCraft is tense. It isn't an exaggeration to say that there's never a moment to relax until a match is over.
Bristling with confidence, I get up to check my next opponent...
... and... it’s...
 Accel....
I draw my lips in a line and let my shoulders slouch. Welp, that's the end of this tournament run.
Accel is one of South Korea’s strongest terran players. He’s well known for his old school cred, balanced playstyle, and friendly banter.
He lost in the round of eight of last season’s VSL. A respectable finish, if not a high-paying one.
From what I remember, Accel was a damn good Brood War player. But he was out of his prime when the sequel hit last year, so it makes sense that he switched.
While I’m considering what sort of rush I should do to steal a win, I feel a tap on my shoulder and turn.
Huh. So you are a foreigner.
... And find none other than the man himself standing there.
This is a bit surreal, considering I've followed Accel's play for about as long as I've been into StarCraft. Luckily, his nonchalant manner disarms my surprise.
Yeah. I think we play next round. I'm Mach, a terran.
He misses a beat before regaining his smile, likely surprised that I understood and then answered him.
Yeah, I saw you won your game. Not bad.
It’s not common to see foreigners at All-Out Attack. Are you on a team?
I’m not. Trying to find one though. I'm sure you know how that goes.
I grin stupidly, which Accel doesn’t seem to mind. He pauses to scratch his cheek before responding.
Well, good luck. Don't expect another easy match.
You too. Uh. I mean, thanks.
Goddamn it. At least he laughed.
My stress from before is mostly gone. If I lose, big deal. I’m expected to lose. If I win, I beat Accel!
I’m still chewing over which cheese I should perform before finally deciding just to play standard. I shouldn't squander the rare chance to practice against a top player.
He and I banter back and forth in the pre-game lobby for a bit before the game gets underway.
I didn’t exactly throw my lead, but I did get seriously outplayed.
Fantasizing about how a victory would have felt doesn't help me keep my mind off the loss. Knowing that I did my best only helps so much.
But not a moment later, Accel turns the corner with a smile and raised eyebrows.
Good game man, you’re actually not bad. I assumed you were here for fun or something.
Oh, uh, thanks. I am here for fun though. You play really well.
I’m surprised, most foreigners don’t hit timings like that. Good vision control too. And your scouting was top notch.
You’re really not on a team? Are you at least staying at a team house? Oh, are you studying abroad?
Nothing like that. I’m staying by myself in an apartment by the VSL studios.
So you came to Korea alone and on your own dime... And you’re not just visiting?
Err... Yes?
I do my best not to seem awkward about my answer, but any reason to worry disappears when Accel smiles.
It takes some serious guts to move out here like that. I can't think of a single person who's made it out here on their own.
A few nearby competitors watch our conversation. It’s probably not often that Accel gives his attention to a random nobody he crushes early in a bracket.
I've got some time before my next game. Let me introduce you to a friend of mine.
Oh. Sure.
With a nod, Accel leads me from the PC area to the back of the cafe.
We pass a number of known players on the way there, most lounging around no differently than the cafe's other patrons.
Maybe they aren't that different. I guess even professionals like to kick back with the tangle of cords and rush of caffeine every now and then.
Games shouldn’t be all business all the time. Although, I’d bet that KPGA executives disagree.
Accel comes to a stop away from the constant tapping of keyboards. He then plops himself into a seat against a wall and invites me to join him with a wave of his hand.
As I take my seat, I look up to find someone I recognize at his side.
Jett. A zerg and former VSL champion.
She won StarCraft 2's very first Grand Final back in the beta. A year ago, she might have been the game’s most famous player.
Her flippant and inflammatory antics have made her a somewhat controversial figure. She rarely ggs and isn't afraid to talk trash on stage.
And there she is, just sitting there. It's all I can do not to stare.
A smile plays on her lips when she glances past me to Accel.
Accel, seriously. Stop promising my autograph as a reward for beating you.
Hilarious. He can understand you, by the way. Who are you up against next round?
Some zerg dishwasher on LhT Slash. Ugh, I hate ZvZ.
Jett rolls her eyes back to me. After a brief appraisal, she lifts her chin and speaks a single word.
Name?
What? Oh. I'm Mach, a terran. I'm on... Uh, well. I'm teamless.
Jett shifts her gaze back to Accel as if to ask, ‘Why did you bring this noob back here?’
But before she can actually say anything, Accel comes to my defense with an easy smile.
Hey, cool it with the judgment until you've seen him play.
Plus, you ever hear of a foreigner that came out here alone, just for StarCraft? My man right here did. You have to admit that's brave.
If that endorsement wasn’t convincing enough, he offers one of his classic grins for good measure. The response seems to satisfy her. For now.
While I try to keep from showing anything to contradict Accel's assessment, Jett aims her attention back at me.
Didn't see your name on the list of people who made it past the VSL qualifier. How'd you place?
I lost my second to last match. The qualifier before that, I dropped out on the final game of the last series.
Two attempts without making it, huh? Hard to tell much from that. Mainly depends on the bracket you had.
How do you live out here with no team? Do you stream or something?
I used to stream, but I don't get enough viewers to make any money. My following is pretty small.
Small is an understatement. Nonexistent is closer to the truth.
So your parents pay for everything?
No. I’m here on my summer job earnings and a little bit extra from my grandparents.
Hm. How lucky. I never got any handouts.
This isn’t going very well. Still, Accel looks as collected as ever, watching with a smile as the interrogation continues.
Did you play Brood War?
Not really. I mean, I had a copy as a kid, but I wasn’t good. Had to cheat to even finish the campaign.
Oh, then you were only a little bit worse than Jett.
Jett scowls silently at the jab. It's true that the two years she spent playing Brood War were mostly unremarkable.
Then this is your first try at professional gaming?
When I nod, she gives me a hard look.
Why are you out here?
... Eh? What do you mean?
I'm sure you're aware of your chances. It's been more than five years since a foreign pro-gamer accomplished anything noteworthy in Korea.
I know what she's getting at, but it's not like I have a particularly great or unique answer. I scratch behind my head and look away.
I mean, why else? I want to become better at StarCraft. Everyone knows that Korea is the place to do that.
And why is that?
Well. Because the best players are out here, also I've studied the language for a while now so I have a—
No! I'm asking why you want to become better.
Oh! Er...
It feels like she's forcibly extracting the truth from me. All the same, I can't leave her expression unanswered.
I do my best to avoid showing the embarassment I feel in my honest response.
... Because I want to be a champion. Or, at the least, show I can compete at that level. Everyone who plays this game wants that, don't they?
Tch. You're right about one thing. Every idiot that makes it to grandmaster and takes a map off of a good player thinks they’re pro-gamer material.
A champion, huh? Sheesh.
She clicks her tongue and sighs, but doesn't seem displeased. Well, at least any moreso than usual.
I wouldn't have much ground to stand on if I disagreed with her. Jett is one of the few who has accomplished what the rest of us dream about.
Don’t be so harsh. His style is solid and he stood toe to toe with me for a while. With enough time, he could compete.
What do you think? Why don’t you practice with him a bit?
I could. Little harm in giving him a chance.
Uh, wait. Back up. What just happened? Did he say practice, and did she say yes?
Accel answers her with a pleased expression. Jett takes a moment to stretch out before again crossing her arms across her chest.
Stop staring and say something, Mach.
The sound of my name wakes me from my stunned silence. I jolt upright and offer a flurry of nods.
Sorry! I say yes. I definitely say yes.
Jett and Accel watch me in silence until I lower myself back into my seat.
It takes some determination to come out here alone. Let's see if it translates to wins, eh?
With a thumbs up, it’s settled. I have somehow found myself with one of the best practice partners in the world.
I really hope this isn’t just for the novelty of playing with some random foreigner.
Accel, it's about time to get back to All-Out Attack. Wouldn't want you getting DQed if we'll be matching in the semis.
Can you be certain that I didn't lose to Mach already? What if this was my way of saving face?
Funny. Have you lost to a foreigner even once?
Hey, you never know who's playing on a barcode account.
You sure you don't want to pot split? Final offer.
Collude? With you? Not a chance.
What about you, Mach? Gonna stick around?
A PC bang with the bustle of a tournament isn’t a great training environment. The bracket will probably take a few hours to work through too.
No, I’m gonna head home. Got a lot of practicing to do tonight.
Leaving already? Well, hey. It was good to meet you man.
Be at Golden Zonefire tomorrow morning and we’ll find out if you’re overhyped.
Will do.
I rise and offer them each a nod in thanks before heading back towards the PC area.
The last thing I see is a vague smile from Jett as she leans over and whispers something to Accel.
I squeeze my way through the growing crowd and manage to make it through the doorway leading outside.
When I hit the street, I’m met with a cool breeze and a rush of voices, sound, and light.
This is it. A shot. One final shot to make it happen.
One last chance to live the life I want.
I quicken my pace, eager for the comfort of a dark room and bright monitor.
This is the day that everything changes.
True to her word, Jett sent me a reminder to get over to Golden Zonefire for some morning practice.
I enjoy playing online and all, but matching against someone only a few feet away is way more productive.
Talking over games in person makes it easier to get feedback and improve. And that's what I need more than anything else.
The sting from my failure at the VSL qualifier will take time to fade. I don't want to experience that pain ever again.
I catch sight of Jett in a middle row, her attention locked on a ladder game. Without disturbing her, I take a seat at her side and watch the match unfold.
Furious taps and clicks rattle her keyboard. Her focus never drops from the game, much less her monitor. She's ahead, though not by much.
It's not long until she extends her lead in the late game and, a few minutes later, heaves a sigh of relief when her opponent ragequits out.
There's no need for me to consult my Korean skills to understand his final message: zerg imba.
You actually showed. Color me surprised.
How could I not? The better question is how you have the free time to practice with some amateur.
I'm the charitable sort, obviously.
Anyway, you're here, so let's stop wasting time. You've paid for your PC, yeah?
I nod and log myself in at the station next to hers. A minute later, the two of us are grinding out practice matches.
Before we get into the next game, I catch sight of a familiar face coming into the cafe.
Huh. Isn't that the same guy from last night?
Hey Jett. Do you know who that is?
I thumb in the stranger’s direction as he passes by us, his attention occupied by a cell phone screen. Jett trails a look after him, wrinkles her nose, and shrugs.
He’s a KPGA player. Protoss. What about him? C’mon, get into the game already.
Seriously? He was at All-Out Attack yesterday. What's he doing outside of his team house two days in a row?
They’re only figuratively chained to their desks. Not all of them are shut-ins. Stop wasting time, let’s go.
I double take away from Jett to find the player in question seated a few rows in front of us.
... And he's got the StarCraft 2 client open. Why would a KPGA player spend his practice time on anything but Brood War? Hm.
Should I ask him for a game? I think I’m going to ask him for a game.
What? No. Hold on, wait. You can't just—
But before she can stop me, I rise and shuffle my way past the rows of computers. Jett shoots me a withering glare over the top of her station before ducking back down.
Even though I’ve barely interacted with the guy, I can’t help but feel a little anxious as I edge closer to his PC.
Sure, he was a bit rude when we spoke. But the chance to challenge a KPGA pro is too good to pass up, especially if I'm trying to step up my game.
He’s about to jump into a match when I clear my throat right behind him. He subtly alt-tabs and then turns to regard me through half-lidded eyes.
What?
Excuse me. Would you mind a practice game?
Uh. No. I’m just here to...
He pauses. Recognition flits across his face.
You're the guy from All-Out Attack yesterday, aren't you?
I nod sheepishly. His only reaction is to stare on.
For a moment, he looks ready to dismiss me and get to laddering. But at the last second, he nods.
Alright. One game.
With a final nod, I return to my station. A moment later, he and I share a game lobby and are just about ready to begin.
He's playing on a barcode account. Typical. How have I still not managed to catch this guy’s name?
A sharp tap against my headphones announces Jett’s return and displeasure.
You're obnoxious. If you lose and embarass me by association, I'm going to pretend I don't know you.
Anything else Jett has to say is drowned out along with the sounds of Golden Zonefire when I pull the earpad back on.
I don’t have long to sulk in defeat before the KPGA player makes his way over to me with a smirk. As promised, Jett is nowhere to be seen.
That was ugly.
Tch. The worst part is that I don't even disagree with him.
Yeah. Well. Nice micro, I guess.
You guess? Well, maybe you're right. Didn't take all that much effort to defend against such a pitiful rush.
His grin darkens to one without humor. Is this guy serious?
What the hell is your problem?
You demand a game and whine when you get a little push-back? Look who's talking!
Everyone knows your type: the foreigner out to make a name for himself. You fly out here on a whim and waste six weeks 'training.' You aren’t the first and unfortunately won’t be the last.
Your plane ticket doesn't buy you the right to call yourself a pro-gamer. Save your money and your time and go back home.
I feel the heat rise in my face, half in anger and half in embarrassment. I’ve never dealt well with confrontation.
But before I can say anything else, Jett steps out from around the corner and cuts between the two of us.
Still great at making friends, huh Bolt?
He glances between the two of us, surprised. After a moment's pause, the so-called Bolt seizes back his smirk and meets Jett with a step forward.
Been awhile, hasn't it? What's a supposed StarLeague champion doing with trash like this?
Bolt looks past her and tilts his head towards me. I take a step towards him, but an open palm from Jett stops me from going any further.
Maybe I shouldn't be surprised. Jumping ship to a scene bloated with foreign money has its upsides, but it won't be long before you forget the dignity of a pro-gamer.
The dignity of a pro-gamer, huh? You make it sound so distinguished.
You've changed for the worse and you don't even realize it. How sad.
Shouldn't be much longer until the KPGA finally accepts that there's no future in Brood War. You're smart enough to know what happens then. But hey, the scene could always use more casters.
Whatever you say. For the record, what excuse did you give your coach for another day off? VIP's a little more lax than Shock T1, but I might want to borrow it someday.
At that, Bolt scowls. Jett doesn't waste the opening and strikes again.
Don't worry dongsaeng, your secret's safe with me. Run along now, I'm sure you've got coins to flip or something.
The standoff lasts a moment longer before Bolt lets out a lazy shrug, instantly killing off the intensity in his expression.
I’ve got better things to do than offer advice to a mouthy chobo. Do what you want, kid.
He thumbs his nose at me and returns to his station without another word.
As soon as Bolt's out of sight, Jett takes my arm in a vice and practically drags me away.
What the hell was that?! He didn't even scout you! Is this how they play on the NA servers?
Even after a heated confrontation, her concern is with the match before anything else. I almost laugh.
It was stupid of me. I thought I could just grab a quick win...
Play what you practice, for god's sake. If you're going to two rax in a tournament match, you better be damn sure you've done it a hundred times on ladder.
Her pointed critique defuses the tension from moments prior, even if it doesn't exactly make me feel any better.
When she's done going through my long list of mistakes, Jett flicks a hand back towards the PCs.
Come on. Queue up a game against me.
I don’t have long to sulk in defeat before the KPGA player makes his way over to me with a smirk. As promised, Jett is nowhere to be seen.
That was greedy.
Though it’s difficult to be graceful in defeat, I try my best anyway.
Yeah, well. It's not something I've practiced a whole lot, and I didn't really produce as efficiently as I could have.
Wouldn't have mattered. Bad mechanics should be the least of your worries.
His grin darkens to one without humor. Is this guy serious?

As soon as Bolt's out of sight, Jett takes my arm in a vice and practically drags me away.
What the hell was that?! Did you close your eyes, expand, and hope for the best?
Even after a heated confrontation, her concern is with the match before anything else. I almost laugh.
I don't know. I was trying to be kinda tricky and put my third base where he wouldn't have normally scouted.
It's blatantly obvious that you're expanding if you haven't shown an army that late in the game. All he had to do was look around the map and collect a free win.
Her pointed critique defuses the tension from moments prior, even if it doesn't exactly make me feel any better.
When she's done going through my long list of mistakes, Jett flicks a hand back towards the PCs.
Come on. Queue up a game against me.
I don’t have long to sulk in defeat before the KPGA player makes his way over to me with a smirk. As promised, Jett is nowhere to be seen.
Hey. You actually know how to play. Wasn't expecting that I'd have to try.
It’s a compliment, regardless of how condescendingly he said it. Though it’s difficult to be graceful in defeat, I try my best anyway.
I played my game the best I could. Kept vision on you, dropped when I could...
But it wasn’t enough. Sucks, man. It’s one thing to lose carelessly, but it’s another when everything goes as planned and you fail anyway.
His grin darkens to one without humor. Is this guy serious?

As soon as Bolt's out of sight, Jett takes my arm in a vice and practically drags me away.
You had the game won! What the hell was that? An SCV pull at fifteen minutes? Is this what they teach you on the NA servers?
Even after a heated confrontation, her concern is with the match before anything else. I almost laugh.
My drops crippled him. I thought it would be enough to end the game.
So build units for two minutes and THEN go roll him. Don't be so damn impatient. Your upgrades were late too.
Her pointed critique defuses the tension from moments prior, even if it doesn't exactly make me feel any better.
When she's done going through my long list of mistakes, Jett flicks a hand back towards the PCs.
Come on. Queue up a game against me.
I want to learn more about StarCraft.
I'll watch it later.
Yes, I want to play as the female main character.
No, I want to rethink my choice.
Yes, I want to play as the male main character.
I told Jett that I wasn’t feeling up to practice after we played a few more one-sided games. She seemed annoyed, but agreed with my suggestion to take a short break.
Back in high school, I used to spend most of my time at the library when class was over. To be honest, this is probably the most time I've willingly spent outside of my room since then.
I’m not the type to read for fun or study diligently, but it was nice to have a place to go and be on my own. I've missed those afternoons since I graduated.
But Golden Zonefire is as good a replacement hangout as I could hope for. It's clean and comfortable, and has pretty much everything that I'd need to stay 24/7.
That isn't an exaggeration. Some of the patrons here look practically glued to their chairs.
With a milk tea from one of the vending machines in hand, I return to my seat across from Jett. She isn’t wearing the same scowl from earlier, but I can tell she’d rather be practicing.
What are you drinking?
She snatches up the can across from her and takes a long sip.
Coffee.
What kind of coffee?
Coffee is coffee. I don’t drink sugary junk.
And, for the record, it’s obnoxious to challenge someone that you don’t know to a match.
Is it really such a big deal? I just wanted a practice game against a good player. Seems harmless.
Do you know those types that stream snipe and start shit on message boards so that people pay attention to them?
More than a few come to mind.
That's you. Except you did it in real life.
Cut me some slack. How do you know that guy anyway? His name is Bolt?
Yes. He plays for Shock T1.
Shock, huh? Bolt must be a new recruit. I haven’t paid much attention to them or any other Brood War team since StarCraft 2 came out, but he definitely wasn't on their roster a year ago.
Right. But how do you know him?
Jett clicks her tongue and breaks her gaze away from me. I silently appreciate the reprieve from her death glare.
If you must know, he and I went to the same middle school. I was in the class above him.
Huh, okay. I was thinking he might have knocked you out of a tournament or something.
No. I've never played him in a StarLeague. You don’t need to overanalyze everything.
Silence falls between us while Jett nurses what remains of her drink. I can’t tell if she’s really into the coffee or if she’s just trying to find something to occupy her lips other than our conversation.
I doubt Jett spends much time at PC bangs given that she's got a team house to practice from. I should consider myself lucky that she'd make time to come out here at all.
You know it makes zero sense for you to focus on qualifying for VSL, right?
I blink myself from my thoughts to meet Jett's intense stare.
What do you mean? What’s the point of us meeting up to practice then?
No. I'm not saying— Listen.
I want to round up some players.
For what?
For VSTL.
Team league? But you’re already on a team.
Yeah.
Yeah?
She wavers, considering whether or not to tell me what I’ve already figured out.
You’re leaving VIP?
Jett’s eyes jump to mine, brows raised in surprise and then furrowed in annoyance. She’s been on VIP for almost a year and is by far the team's best player.
Management barely pays us and nobody is motivated. They're worse than bad, they're complacent. I want a fresh start.
Hey, I’m not guilting you. It just isn’t something I expected to hear. Do you have a team house picked out?
No. Not yet.
What about a coach?
... No.
Uh, well, do you have players in mind?
Look! It’s a work in progress, okay?!
I edge away from her glare and raise my hands defensively.
Okay, okay! I won’t ask again.
For awhile, silence. Jett does her best to avoid eye contact, but I can tell she’s thinking hard about something.
Just as I'm about to rise to replace my milk tea with another, she speaks.
You know about all of those new foreign teams popping up recently, right?
Err, yeah. What about them?
Isn't it strange? They're worse than almost every Korean squad, yet most of them have more sponsors.
Well, there are a lot of eSports fans outside of Korea these days. People want to support their hometown heroes.
I don't think it's that simple.
What? Where would the money come from if not the fans?
Idiots.
Er, what?
Idiots. Idiots that call themselves investors. Idiots that throw away money keeping mediocre players afloat because it makes them feel good inside for whatever reason.
Well, she and Bolt agree on one thing, at least.
Um. Okay. Are you going to find some idiots to sponsor you?
No... 
Well.
She takes a long moment to reconsider her answer.
... No. It wouldn't work out in the end.
What I'm getting at is that too much of our scene ignores the foreign fanbase. It's a huge mistake.
Well, there's the time zone difference and a language barrier. Also, I don't know if you know this, but lots of foreign fans don't find Korean players entertaining.
What?! How dare you! That's ridiculous!
I'm just relaying common knowledge! Don't hold me accountable for the opinions of silver-leaguers.
Most Western fan support goes to the people who entertain well. Streamers, casters. Those kind of people.
The most famous players in your scene aren't the best? That's appalling.
Hey, don't pretend like Brood War didn't get famous on the backs of dudes who looked good on camera. If the PC bang was the ship, then fangirls pulled the oars.
That's different. They were pretty and skilled, not one or the other.
And show some respect. Those 'dudes' are the only reason you and I are able to have this conversation.
The sharp response and equally sharp glare suggests that I shouldn't argue the point. Jett knows better than I do anyway.
We're getting off topic. There are tons of potential fans that most Korean teams ignore simply because they're too hard to connect with.
Yeah. I agree.
She lifts an eyebrow and stares at me for just a bit too long before glancing away. If I wasn't sure before, I am now.
Go on, say it.
Say what?!
I know what you’re thinking.
No you don't.
Yes I do.
What am I thinking, then?
You want me to join a new team you're starting so that I can help you with the foreign fanbase.
Also, you invited me here to tryout under the guise of practice.
...
.....................
Jett slumps back in her seat, defeated. I fight a losing battle against the urge to laugh.
Don't look so smug. Ugh, I hate dealing with team management.
You could always hire a manager.
Before we have any players? Maybe I should just keep my head down and practice.
No, don’t do that. I think it's a good idea.
You’re only saying that because I gave you an offer.
Maybe. But hey, if you go through with this, I’ll do whatever I can to help.
How are you the one convincing me to go after my own idea? Dammit.
She chews on her lip, likely considering the harrowing risk of leaving her team.
... I can’t make any commitments until we at least have some other players. It’d be stupid for me to move out of the VIP house without everything lined up.
This is something I’ve been thinking about for a while, even if I don’t have every detail hashed out yet.
I want to keep overhead low and practice time high. Lean and mean.
She aims a finger at me, her dull nail a hair’s breadth before my nose.
If you're going to be a part of this, you're going to pull your weight. You can start by searching for our players, unless you’d rather find me a coach and sponsor.
I cringe backwards and raise my hands.
No, no. Uh. I’ll leave that to you.
Good. It’ll work out better this way. The minimum number of players for team league is four, so you need to find at least two.
You know, this isn’t exactly what I had in mind as the ideal 'join a team' experience.
Walk away if you like. You have a long way to go if you want to be anything other than our translator mascot anyway.
I'll admit though, Accel was right. I see glimpses of high level stuff in your play.
But as of right now, you kind of suck, even by foreigner standards. Offense intended.
You seriously need to start busting your ass. Coming to Korea is pointless if you're still practicing Western hours.
Well. Nobody ever claimed that Jett wasn't honest.
I’m going to work you and everyone else like dogs. If this team comes together, I won't be happy with anything less than first place in VSTL.
Well. I appreciate the chance.
I offer a smile that she's quick to match.
If we're going ahead with this, I've got a lot of stuff to do. The deadline to register for team league is in two weeks, so we can’t afford to waste time. Get moving on your search.
Alright. Good luck. I’ll catch you online.
Yeah. Later.
When she's gone, I fall back into my chair and take a deep breath.
Jett just asked me to join her team.
I pinch my forearm and judge the sensation that follows. With that, my disbelief dissolves into contemplation.
... How the hell am I going to find two worthwhile, unsigned players?
A mixture of guilt and pride led me to spend the rest of the day at Golden Zonefire. Between ladder games and a break for dinner, I scoped out the cafe’s best StarCraft players.
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like any of Golden Zonefire’s regular patrons are much to write home about. There were good players there for All-Out Attack, sure, but today...
Most of the cafe's patrons were playing Brood War. And of the ones that were actually laddering in StarCraft 2, there was only a single guy in master league.
I’ll have to extend my search outside of a single PC bang. I guess it'd have been a little too convenient to find a VSL-caliber player so easily.
I get the urge to stop at a convenience store on the way back to my apartment. There’s one I've been going to regularly for my nightly fix of sugar and caffeine.
The store’s blindingly bright signage is visible from more than a block away. Green capital letters spell out the store’s name in English on a backdrop of white. Go-Mart.
The door’s familiar chime welcomes me, and the same clerk I’ve seen at least a dozen times before stands formally behind a cash register.
He looks a bit old to be working still. Maybe he owns the place and doesn't have help to work the night shift?
I see myself standing behind the counter in an unwanted mental image. It's a fate that could easily await me if I fail to make it as a professional gamer.
I shake my head free of the thought and make my way to the refrigerated section of the store to fill my fists with cans and bottles.
Some of the drinks may have strange names, but I’ll be damned if they aren’t good.
I drop them on the counter in front of the old man and briefly make eye contact with him. He seems to recognize me, but doesn’t say anything to indicate it.
He rings up my drinks slowly, not from age or callouses, but because he's in no great rush. The store's empty aside from me, after all.
6,000 won.
I swipe my credit card in the reader and depart with a polite smile, anxious to return to my apartment.
The clerk returns the expression and watches me go without another word.
The only top-tier player I’m on speaking terms with is Accel, but how would I even approach the subject of getting him to leave his team for a new and untested one?
Maybe it would be better for me to simply get a lead from him. If I can’t manage that, then I’m left to scour local PC bangs and message boards on my own.
Whatever. I'll figure this out tomorrow.
And you had to convince her? Seriously? She’s been talking this up to me for the past two months.
It’s a big change, I guess. And c’mon, I just met you guys. How can she not be hesitant?
Hmm!
Accel grins, no doubt replaying Jett’s angst in his mind’s eye.
Getting in at the ground floor is a major plus. You were in the right place at the right time. If it works out, that is.
Accel glances over his shoulder before returning his attention to me.
Most teams barely pay their players anything. I’ve got it good for someone my age, but even I have part of my winnings taken for the team’s benefit.
Ouch. Luckily for Westerners, that isn’t a trend that has caught on outside of South Korea.
So...
.......
... I can’t do it. It’s impossible. The words simply will not come.
What?
... Oh!
Accel lets out a laugh, genuine and highly amused. He tries to get his words out and, unlike me, eventually ends up succeeding.
Sorry Mach, but no can do. I’m signed with Crash until the end of the year. I’m not allowed to play for anyone else until my contract is up.
As I expected. Really, it shouldn’t come as a surprise. I sigh, fall back into my chair, and rest my palms atop my head.
I had to ask. Jett’s expecting me to pick up our players while she handles the management and sponsorship side of things.
Hey, well. I can help you with the next best thing.
I’d be thankful for any help at all.
Don’t you worry. I’ve got a shortlist of easy pick-ups. An extremely short list.
He clears his throat.
There’s only one person on it. But hey! Better than nothing, right?
Who is it?
Ooh, straight to business. Eager for your bunkbed, I see. Trust me Mach, you’ll want the bottom bunk.
You know from experience?
Sure do. When I was sixteen, some upjumped Brood War clan scraped me from the bottom of the barrel and set me up in their overcrowded sweatshop of a team house.
Had to sleep above someone at least two years past a graceful retirement. I’ve seen solitaire players with better APM. He snored. A lot.
As horrible as he’s trying to make it seem, Accel sounds closer to wistful than bitter as he recounts his first years as a professional gamer.
What happened to the team?
Sponsor flaked. Team didn't have the money for legal action.
Coach didn't tell us until twenty minutes before rent was due. Someone stole my mousepad as we were moving out. And that was the end of my StarCraft career.
Wait, no, it kept going for seven years after that and somehow still isn't over. Always forget that part.
Accel. Top Korean terran, master storyteller.
Anyway. This guy's name is Stunt. Plays protoss. He's pretty good.
... But?
But? Does there have to be a but?
I’m sensing a but.
It’s a small but. He’s incredibly cheesy and maybe a touch arrogant. And he's a high schooler. But, he's good.
Why haven't any other teams picked him up in that case?
He shrugs. I get the feeling that Accel genuinely doesn’t know, but I'm left anxious nonetheless. 
Still, it’s important to have at least some kind of racial distribution on the team.
... Not in terms of foreigner or Korean mind you, but rather of zerg, protoss, and terran.
Hm. Do you know how I could get in touch with him?
I could give you his info for a friend request, but he’d probably block you on the assumption that you’re a fanboy or a goldseller or something.
Your best bet is to find him in person at Stomping Grounds.
... His stomping grounds? What do you mean? Where?
No, no. Stomping Grounds. That’s the name of the PC bang he’s usually at.
Ugh. Another trek across Seoul. I’ve never heard of the place, much less been to it. Accel takes note of my frown and wags a finger at me.
What, you fly halfway across the world and can’t be bothered to walk for half an hour? Take the subway if you’re that lazy.
No, no. It’s fine. I shouldn’t expect this to be easy.
Now we’re talking. Get going. I’ll keep an eye out for your next player in the meantime.
I check the map on my phone for the second time after reading the sign for a third. This is definitely Stomping Grounds.
A deep breath helps calm my nerves. Seconds later, I push open the glass door and make my way inside.
Pretty much as expected. Computers, vending machines, tables, and the sound of two dozen mice and keyboards. PC bangs are nothing if not similar to one another.
When a shiver runs down my back, I realize that the A/C in here is cranked up ridiculously high.
I read somewhere that casinos pump in extra oxygen to keep their patrons awake and alert. Maybe this place has tried to adapt the same tactic to their cafe?
A middle aged woman sits behind the front desk. She glances up at me when I pass by and then returns her attention to the magazine splayed out in front of her.
A quick scan of heads lined up in front of monitors offers me a few potential Stunts amidst the sea of scrubs. By Accel’s description, he’s short and has bleached hair.
I’m able to narrow it down quickly and confirm his identity with a look at his monitor. He’s in the middle of ladder match.
… And he’s playing StarCraft 2 with one hand. The other is occupied with a game on his cell phone.
All the same, Stunt's crushing his opponent with a rush build. And by the look on his face, he takes great pleasure in that fact.
His enemy sends a salty one liner before dropping out of the game without a gg. Stunt grins wide and puts his hands behind his head, satisfied.
After checking the post-game stats, he glances over his shoulder and then spins his chair around to find me watching him.
Sup. Something you want?
Yeah. You're Stunt, right?
That's me. And who are you?
I'm Mach.
Stunt lights up, stands upright, and plants his hands on his hips all at once.
Right! The foreigner that Accel messaged me about. Was starting to think you wouldn’t show up. Let’s get this betmatch going.
HEY EVERYONE! THE BETMATCH IS ON!
What.
... Dammit. Really Accel?
Before I can attempt an explanation, a crowd of six or seven middle school-aged kids forms behind Stunt. I don’t see myself talking my way out of this.
Betmatch. Right. That’s me, yes. That’s what I’m here for.
Another chobo is gonna try to betmatch Stunt?
When will they learn? He's the cafe’s best player! Hey Stunt, will you buy me a juice with your winnings?
Stunt ignores the peanut gallery and takes a step forward, sizing me up. Judging by his appearance, it looks like he just started high school. I’m at least a head taller than him.
Accel said you were down for a fifteen thousand won bet, but c’mon. You can do better than that, right?
How much were you thinking?
Twenty-five thousand is a much better number, wouldn’t you say? C’mon, you had to drag your ass all the way over here to play. Let's make it interesting.
That’s what, twenty dollars or so? I’d have to skip a few trips to Go-Mart, but I can’t risk having him turn me down.
Okay, fine. Twenty-five thousand. What are we going to do about maps? Best of three, right?
Nah, best of one is fine. My time’s too valuable. And in a show of good faith, you can pick the map.
Accel wasn’t kidding about this kid's cockiness. Whatever, at least I can choose a map with a long rush distance.
I find a seat at a computer nearby, though not so close that we could catch a glimpse at one another’s screen.
A locked window stares back at me as I sit down—of course, I need to pay to use the PC. But before I can head back to the front desk, Stunt slides in front of me and takes the mouse.
Yo, I got it. Consider it an investment for the money you’re about to give me.
He unlocks the machine with a few clicks and the entry of a password. Huh, that works.
After I thank him, he slinks back over to his setup. Stunt shares a few confident words with the underage crowd behind him and then throws his headphones on.
I host up a game and toss him an invite. It’s not long after that I’m staring down my base and six workers.
My mouse creaks under my grip before I release it and push away from the PC.
Even though I was mentally prepared for a rush, he made it work anyway. What a stupid loss.
Judging by the swagger in Stunt’s walk as he makes his way over to me, he either doesn’t notice the frustration I’m feeling or doesn’t care.
Heh, easy. I call that one the Stunt Special.
I rub my forehead. Admittedly, the kid is pretty good. Accel was right to put me on his trail.
Right, time to pay up.
Oh, yeah. So listen, I’m thinking of start--
I reach for my wallet mid-sentence and then freeze. It's not there.
Hold up.
I pat down all my pockets to discover that I simply don't have it. Did I leave it back at my apartment? I didn’t know I was showing up to a betmatch!
... Are you serious? You don’t have any money?
With a blanched expression, I confirm his suspicion with a nod.
I can explain this, really. I didn’t know I was showing up to a betmatch. Accel put me on your trail because I’m recruiting for a new team.
With a gaggle of middle schoolers egging him on with jeers, he thumbs his nose at me.
You’re just trying to get out of paying for your loss. That’s real low, man. Real low.
You couldn’t hold my all-in and don’t bring your wallet to a betmatch, and I’m supposed to expect you to organize a team? Yeah, I don’t think so.
Stunt, wait. We’ve got—
Shit. Jett is technically still on VIP… Can I tell him that she’s planning to leave? What if he tells someone? Why didn’t I think of this ahead of time!?
We… have some good players about to sign and a sponsor in the works. Nothing official, we’re keeping everything under wraps until then.
Yeah, people have tried this sketchy shit with me before. It’s not happening. I paid for your PC, and now you repay me with this crap? Get lost, man.
Wait! This is a great opportunity, I’m serious!
But any hope I have of getting Stunt to change his mind is drowned out by the boos of the middle schooler cadre.
You suck! You lost to Stunt, he’s the best!
Loser! Now he can’t buy me a juice!
Pay up, loser!
I glance past the chest-high crowd to search out Stunt, but it’s too late. He’s gone.
How did I mess this up so bad?
Stunt pushes through the dumbfounded crowd and comes stomping over, fury in his eyes. He really didn’t expect to lose.
YOU BLINDLY SCOUT THE SMOKE IN YOUR BASE!? AFTER A CANNON RUSH!? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! WHO DOES THAT?!
I raise my hands defensively and skirt away from the victory screen splashed across my monitor.
Woah, woah! Calm down. It takes like five seconds. And you have a reputation for those kind of builds, you know.
He makes a disgruntled sound and stares hard at me.
You got lucky! Typical terran players. And I'm taking back my—
What are you yelling back there for? Didn’t I tell you to sweep up the backroom an hour ago? Stop screaming at our customers and go do something useful! Lord have mercy!
Without warning, the woman at the front desk paints Stunt a bright red from across the room.
She glares at him for a moment longer before ducking back behind the counter. Talk about lousy bosses.
His anger replaced with modesty, Stunt scratches behind his head. The middle-schoolers have mostly dispersed, evidently destroyed by the cruel realization that their protoss god can bleed.
... Ehh. Sorry. That’s my mom. Anyway, you beat me. Lemme go get your cash.
His mom? Egh, even worse. I guess I can see the resemblance, minus the bleached hair. Explains how he unlocked my PC, at least.
Actually, wait. I didn’t come here for a betmatch.
What? But we just played one.
... I don’t have to pay you then?
What? No. I’m recruiting for a new team. Accel mentioned that you were a free agent, and I wanted to see if you’d join up.
I guess he thought it’d be funny to trick me into a betmatch with you.
A foreign team? Why didn’t you just send me a message or something?
No, a Korean one. And Accel said you’d probably assume I was a fanboy and block me. Although, I get the feeling that was just his excuse for this whole setup...
Man, Accel. Couldn't we have just kept this simple? What if I had lost?!
Stunt pauses and reaches for his phone. Distracted or no, he manages to carry on the conversation.
Nah, blocking you sounds like something I’d do. Anyway, who else have you got?
We’ve got—
Wait. Jett is technically still on VIP… Can I tell him that she’s planning to leave? What if he tells someone? Why didn’t I think of this ahead of time!?
You've got...?
We… have some good players about to sign and a sponsor in the works. Nothing official, we’re trying to keep everything under wraps until then.
Sounds sketchy. A mystery sponsor and mystery players.
He doesn’t seem convinced. I can hardly blame him. This sort of thing is unfortunately common in eSports.
But Accel did vouch for you. That’s worth something. And you beat me, the future protoss bonjwa.
Once we’ve got four players and some management, we’re going to pick out a team house. You'll need to live and practice with us.
I blink once, look away, and take a tactical pause.
Oh, uh, if your mom will let you move out, that is.
He rises to my bait and straightens up, both fists clenched.
You're damn right she's going to let me!
Alright dude, consider me signed. If I've got a room and enough money to pay for food, we’re in business.
Stunt pauses and lowers himself from the tips of his toes.
What’s the team called, by the way?
Like I said, it’s a work in progress. I’ll let you know when it’s picked out.
If we’re not named yet, I want a say in it.
How about AzureBlaze Phoenix Snipers?
What even...? Kid, this isn't a shonen anime.
Yeah. Probably not.
While Stunt revels in the afterglow of being signed to a StarCraft team, a thought occurs to me.
Wait, don’t you go to school?
Uhh. Let's just say I'm between schools right now.
I don’t bother trying to divulge anymore information. If he can live in the team house and perform, that's good enough for me.
Some promising young pros deferred school for Brood War back in the day. And if StarCraft doesn’t work out for him, at least he's got a future cleaning up Stomping Grounds.
Right. The mysteries won’t last for long, I promise. I’ll be in touch if I need you to show up somewhere.
Okay. I’m going to hit you up for practice games tonight, if that’s cool. Be online.
Sounds good. Welcome aboard, kid.
The fiery protoss player lifts his chin for a final grin before heading into one of the PC bang’s back rooms, probably to gather a broom and dustpan.
I grace Stunt’s mom with an innocent expression on my way out. She answers my smile with a glare sharp enough to make the hair on the back of my neck stand up.
I step outside and suck in a deep breath, relieved. The warm, afternoon air is sweet and feels good in my lungs.
One down.
The stairway to my apartment was empty as usual. Sometimes it feels like I’m the only person living in this building.
Isolation was a major concern when I was first thinking about coming overseas. If my Korean wasn’t passable, it’d practically impossible for me to be anything but lonely.
That's something I don't need to worry about anymore, I suppose. Seoul's proven to be vibrant, crowded, and busy. Everything my life back home wasn’t.
Something as simple as crossing the street can be exciting for someone who has never been in an urban environment for more than a few hours at a time. It sounds stupid, but it’s true.
Still, before meeting Accel and Jett, I barely talked to anyone offline. StarCraft’s one on one nature doesn’t exactly lend itself to social introductions.
It'd be easy to get in touch with the foreigner community out here. But I have very little desire to skulk around bars with jaded English teachers and washed-up businessmen. Why bother?
I sink into my chair and jam the spacebar a few times to wake up my PC. I practiced enough at Golden Zonefire after recruiting Stunt, so I don’t bother loading up StarCraft.
Jett was pleased to hear about my new pickup. Told me it was smart to hold off on telling Stunt who she was, too.
I’m sure she’ll announce her plans on her own time. She’ll have to once we’ve picked up our last player at any rate.
With a few clicks I’m staring at a common StarCraft fan site. The most interesting stuff that goes on in the scene gets posted here, and what people vote as best rises to the top of the page.
I don’t often visit the Korean community sites. I like them just fine, but I prefer to read English when I get the chance.
But no matter where you choose to get your StarCraft news, you’ll find no shortage of netizens sure in their opinions on which player is awful or why the game is imbalanced.
Today seems to be no exception. A foreign pro-gamer just called it quits, and the comments about him are ridiculously scathing.
Sure, he was underperforming recently. But people forget just how much time and passion gets put into even a mediocre professional’s career.
The worst part is that most of the people talking smack are either low leaguers or don’t play the game at all.
I take out my phone, hoping to find something on it to distract me from the mindless masses. No texts, no new emails. Same as when I last checked fifteen minutes ago.
It’s been awhile since I’ve chatted with my friends from back home. Most of them know about my eSports aspirations, but none of them really get it.
There’s two reactions when someone learns that you play video games full time: Either they roll their eyes, or they tell you how lucky you are.
I’ve tried to explain to the latter that playing StarCraft really isn’t fun in the traditional sense. Winning can be satisfying, but the game is too stressful to actually be called fun. At least, for me.
It beats a boring minimum wage job, but it sure as hell isn’t easy and pays less for all but the best. Yeah, they don't mention that between games on StarLeague streams.
Pretty much everyone I went to high school with is enrolled in college. When I hear about their great social lives and internships, I can't help but feel jealous.
I’ll probably end up going eventually. It’s not like I can make a living from games when I’m thirty.
Five or six years of StarCraft, and then you’re left with the dregs of your prize money and sore wrists. And hopefully some friends and fond memories.
With a look back at the computer screen, I notice that my inbox has a message awaiting. A click, and I’m staring and at a piece of fanmail, the first I’ve received in a month.
Maybe it's inaccurate to call it fanmail considering I've known this guy since before I first started playing StarCraft in high school.
Stream? What, so ten people can watch me play faceless barcodes all day? Pointless. Maybe if I got enough viewers to make some money.
He and I really didn't even talk back in school. It wasn't until he found out about my StarCraft skill after graduation that he tried to become my friend.
I massage my temples, frustrated. All that message did was put me in a bad mood.
Most of the people who follow StarCraft know less about the game itself than they do about the people playing it. I don't like that I'm expected to constantly bear the scrunity of strangers.
The community is what keeps the scene alive. I know it's wrong to loathe it. But simply knowing that doesn't make it any easier not to.
With an impatient click, my PC groans off. I climb under my sheets and settle in for an early night’s rest.
The search continues tomorrow.
I wake to the sound of rain against my window. Judging by the light, it's morning.
It dawns on me that I was supposed to play Stunt in a few practice games last night. Whoops. Probably not a great move to blow off the player I just recruited.
Breakfast this morning is cold as usual, or at least since I took a chance on some street food. 
It was actually pretty good, but I ended up sick for a few days. I’ve stuck with cereal in the mornings since then.
I hope everything is working out on Jett’s end. Good management and even a single sponsor will take us a long way. 
All I can do is focus on the task at hand: finding talent.
I put away my bowl once I’ve emptied it and lock my apartment on the way out.
My sweatshirt's hood held up against the rain for most of the way, but my hair ended up soaked in the end.
I shake my head dry once I'm inside, much to the annoyance of the guy at Golden Zonefire's front desk.
The cafe is largely empty on most weekdays, at least before schools let out. 
With a bit of searching, I find Accel reclined drowsily in a computer chair that he must have wheeled over to the lounge area. 
I'll bet he'd rather be sleeping in at the Crash team house, but Accel said that he didn’t have time to meet me any later.
He yawns and waves me over. I pull up a chair from a nearby PC and sit beside him—plenty to choose from when the place is this empty.
Do they not have umbrellas outside of Korea?
No. Everyone just sprints from place to place if it rains.
Ha. So, anyway, Stunt agreed?
Yeah. It’ll make the next pick-up even easier since I’ve actually got another player to point to. I wish Jett would hurry up and ditch her team already.
Accel raises an eyebrow and shakes his head at me.
She can’t do that yet. Jett has a contract.
It has to be over soon though, right? Why else would she be putting together a team if she wouldn’t be able to play on it?
They vary, but most contracts last either six months or a year. Best case scenario, she’ll be free at the end of the month.
That makes sense. The Victory StarLeague won’t let anyone with a contract play without their team's approval, but maybe there’s no rule against registering ahead of time?
Whatever, I’m sure that Jett has this figured out already.
Right. Anyway, you said you’ve got a lead on the next player, yeah?
Yep. Guy named Reva. Flits in and out of top eight on the ladder. He’s won at least a dozen online tournaments this year.
Wow. What race does he play?
Here’s the best part. He plays all three. His terran is his strongest, but he’s been known to switch between races during a long set. He'll even play random.
Reva plays zerg, terran, and protoss? Woah. That sounds too good to be true.
But this is where it gets weird. He’s never turned up to a tournament in person. Only plays online. Some people speculate that Reva is just an alias for a top player.
I’m not convinced, though.
He’s got a very specific playstyle. It’s almost like playing against a highly advanced A.I. Strong mechanically, but only goes for standard macro games.
So how am I going to get in touch with him? Other teams have to have gone after a player that good.
It won’t be easy, but I’ve got a plan.
Not another betmatch, please…
Heh. It worked, didn’t it? No, no. Not this time.
Reva’s on a mean win streak in an online king of the hill. Twelve wins in a row.
Granted, most of his games have been against foreigners. It's based in Europe so it's at a weird hour for us...
Point is, you’re going to enter tonight.
Tonight? So I beat him, and then use that to convince him to join the team?
Hold on. I didn’t say anything about beating him. I mean, if you do, I’m not going to complain.
You’re going to play an 
honorable macro game.
Reva hates anything that’s non-standard. Cheese, rushes, aggressive timings, all-ins, one-base builds... That sort of thing. So you're going to play a slow, economy-based game instead.
But if I play a game in the exact style he’s used to, won't I get stomped?
Maybe. But it’s your only chance to get on his good side. Play him, show off your skill, chat him up, and recruit him.
You make it sound so easy.
Hey, find your own players if you don’t like it. I’m sure there are tons of strategy forum scrubs willing to tryout.
He does have a point. Guess I’m staying in tonight.
Fine. By the way, what are you so busy with this afternoon?
Team league practice. Gotta drill a zerg of ours to snipe the Team KaiNE terran ace.
The match is half a week away. Until then, practice, practice, practice. That’s how we do it.
Beneath his easy facade, I can tell that Accel doesn’t seem too pleased by the circumstance.
Right then. Any final tips against Reva before I go practice for tonight?
Yeah. Hope you like mech.
It's all I can do not to groan.
My favorite.
The admin said it shouldn’t be more than five minutes now. Reva just got finished extending his record to thirteen wins.
I’m already warmed up from practicing all day, so there’s no point of loading up a map to drill my micro or anything like that. 
The only thing I’ve got to focus on before the game is my build and my nerves.
Most players, myself included, tend to get a little bit jittery before a high stakes match. 
It’s a more serious issue at live events with all the lights and cameras and cheering fans, but it can happen in an online setting just as easily.
This king of the hill is broadcast on a commentated livestream. The channel hosting it isn’t particularly popular, but the exposure can’t hurt.
Unless I get beat really, really badly.
Looks like the game is getting started. In the pre-game lobby, Reva remains utterly silent even after I offer a friendly glgl.
Whatever. Let’s get this going.
Phew. That didn’t go so bad. Reva went down a little easier than I expected, though.
Does this mean I need to continue with the koth? I hadn’t considered that. Gotta wrap up a conversation with Reva quickly in that case.
I open up a chat and fire off a message.
gg. lucky hard counter for me lolol;;
… Nothing.
Even after thirty seconds, there’s still no response. Adamantly, I try once more.
hey listen, you play pretty well. would you be interested in some practice?
What follows my second message is not a response, but a notification that Reva has gone offline.
What! What is this guy in such a hurry for? Because I rushed him?! How the hell am I supposed to get into contact with this guy now?
I think to ask through one of the tournament organizers for him to unblock me. But before I can do so, I receive an invite to the next game.
In the pre-game lobby, my new opponent takes a few subtle jabs at my strategy from last game.
keke, you haven’t watched this koth’s stream before have you?
? no, why
take my advice, dont cheese again if you like your reputation ^^
Rather than pry an answer out of this stranger, I decide to turn on the stream and see what he’s talking about for myself.
… And I find that the casters are talking trash about me. Seriously? Just because I did a rush build?
What kind of arrogant assholes are these commentators? Screw this. If Reva couldn’t handle a rush and frequents a king of the hill like this, then why would I bother recruiting him?
Frustrated, I make my opponent aware that I’m forfeiting the match and shut off my PC in a huff.
Okay… Can’t screw this up. I pop open a chatbox and fire off a message.
your macro is too good lolol
For a while, no response. But just when I’ve given up hope that he’ll message me back...
Thank you. You play well. You made only a few key mistakes.
Perfect capitalization and grammar? Ugh, whenever anyone does this to me, I feel obligated to fix my typing. 
Screw it, I’m way too tired after forty minutes of positional play.
oh ya? well thanks. im actually looking for some practice partners, kinda.
Kind of? How?
well, im starting a team with a few friends. we’re gonna try to qualify for team league.
I see.
im actually looking to pick up another player atm. would you be interested?
For almost ten seconds, nothing. Each second ticking by feels longer than the last. But then...
I am willing to discuss the possibility.
oh awesome, we’re gonna meet up at golden zonefire tomorrow afternoon. you’re in seoul, ya? you know where it is?
Oh. You wish to meet in person?
C’mon! I’ve already come this far! Keep it together!
ya just gonna hang with the team and practice a bit. we’re nice, I swear.
Another pause, this time longer. I find myself drawing closer and closer to the screen in anticipation of Reva’s reply.
Very well. I will see you and your teammates at Golden Zonefire tomorrow. How do you suggest I find you?
kk. look for the foreigner lol.
I will do so. Goodbye.
With that, Reva exits our chat and prepares for his next king of the hill match.
Did I do it? Did I recruit our last player? Can I celebrate yet?
No. Better to wait. I mean, he’s never even been to an event in person before. There’s a chance that he won’t show.
I step out of my chair and fall onto my bed, simultaneously tired and restless. I shut my eyes, but there’s no way I’m going to sleep tonight with this hanging over my head.
Maybe I should go to Go-Mart. It’s not a good idea to drink caffeinated stuff this late at night, but a walk might get my mind off of the stress.
Since meeting Accel and Jett, the pangs of homesickness haven’t been nearly as bad.
Should I feel guilty that I only want to update my old friends or my parents now that I’ve actually got something going my way? Is it better to keep these small victories to myself?
When was the last time I even spoke English? I honestly can’t remember.
I never had to move around or switch schools when I was a kid, but maybe this is the same thing. You find a group and stick with it. Keeping in touch with your old friends becomes too difficult.
It could be a good thing. More focus on making my eSports career work than on what so and so switched his major to.
I can’t help but feel a little unsure. Putting my old life down isn’t easy knowing that I’ll have to pick it back up eventually.
My thoughts of home fade as the green and white signage comes into view.
The old man is behind the counter as always, this time restocking the shelf on his side beneath the cash register.
I take my usual fare from the refrigerators in the back of the store and step to the counter. The clerk’s haggard eyes linger on me for a moment before he returns to his shelf-stocking.
Just a moment.
I’m in no rush so I answer him with a nod. I let the drinks rest on the laminated counter and turn to take a closer look at the convenience store.
It’s compact and clean, like pretty much everything else in Seoul. If it has any employees other than the old man on duty, I don’t see them.
Most stores don't have foreign snacks or drinks aside from their localized variants, and Go-Mart is no exception to that. I’ve had to be bold in trying new food.
Just as I'm about to step towards a bag of strange looking trail mix, the clerk’s voice sounds from behind.
You’ve been in here quite often, haven’t you?
I turn, surprised. He’s staring right at me.
Err, yeah. I’m not… That’s okay, isn’t it?
He pauses in surprise, likely at my language proficiency, and then presses right on.
More than okay. Those drinks don’t buy themselves. What’s your name?
I'm Mach... Uh, wait a second. That's not right.
Strangely enough, I haven’t had to share my real name with anyone since I came overseas. It feels unfamiliar on my tongue as I prepare to correct myself.
But before I can, the clerk furrows his eyebrows at me.
Mach? That doesn’t sound like any kind of foreign name I’ve heard before.
How am I in this situation? Dammit.
It’s hard to explain. Um, do you know what StarCraft is?
The elderly cashier’s eyes light up in understanding.
I’ve heard of it. You’re a pro-gamer then?
Yeah. Working at it, at least.
I suppose that explains your late night shopping trips. How long have you been in Seoul?
A little more than a month. I like it here.
Good. It’s a fine city.
You can call me Mr. Yeon, by the way. It's good to meet you, Mach.
I simply nod and then look away. I'm not particularly good at talking to strangers about anything other than StarCraft.
The conversation between us doesn’t lead anywhere else, so he starts ringing up my drinks. With the bottles bagged and offered, he smiles.
Take care now.
I make my way back to my apartment for an evening of StarCraft and little sleep.
Remind me why we have to meet up here again? I get to play for free at my mom’s, you know.
And you probably get yelled at if the toilet clogs up too.
Stunt rolls his eyes and pulls out his cell phone, thumb soon jamming away at some weird puzzle game.
What is it exactly that you're always playing on your phone?
I'm glad you asked! It's called PopPop Safari. It's one of those casual games meant to sucker morons out of their money.
And you're playing it why...?
It's my own way of fighting back against something I hate. I'm going to defeat this game in its entirety without paying a single cent!
I don't understand how that stops anything. They're still making money from everyone else, aren't they?
I steal a glance at his phone.
... And there are tons of ads all over your screen. Look.
You don't understand. It's about the principle!
And I wouldn't be playing it in the first place if this dude had showed up when you said he would.
Admittedly, Reva should be here by now, but I can’t do anything except wait for him to arrive.
I texted back and forth with Jett a bit earlier today. She’s too busy wrapping things up with her contact to make it to Golden Zonefire until way later. 
From the tone of her messages, it seemed like talks with the sponsor were going well.
With word that I managed to pick out our fourth player, she gave me the go ahead to divulge her identity to Stunt and Reva. Helpful, since we still have a coach and practice partners to recruit.
I hear the door to Golden Zonefire slide open and I glance over, hopeful.
... Only to find a bespectacled girl walk inside and look around. Tch, no dice. Where the hell is he?
The girl stands at the cafe's entryway for a while, apparently searching for something. Eventually, her eyes catch and then stay on me.
Huh. It looks like she’s coming our way.
Stunt glances up from his cell phone once I turn to address the newcomer. She hesitates before speaking and delivers her words quietly.
Excuse me, are you Mach?
Oh, hi. That’s me.
I apologize for the delay. I disembarked the subway a stop too early. Is this one of the teammates that you mentioned?
She shifts her focus from me to Stunt. His expression is no doubt as perplexed as my own. Is she…?
Wait a second. Are you Reva?
Yes, I am.
Oh, I’m sorry! I didn’t realize that you were a girl. I just assumed...
I trail off quietly. If the mix-up bothered Reva, she doesn’t show it. She tilts her head slightly and edges closer to our table.
May I sit?
Of course. Reva, this is Stunt. He’s the team’s only protoss.
Sup.
He silences the obnoxious bleeps and bloops of his phone’s game in his pocket and bobs his head at Reva.
Reva, huh? Doesn’t sound too familiar. You must be some online hero.
Stunt. I am familiar with you.
Eh? How? 
I mean, of course you are! I'm the god of protoss after all!
No. We have matched on ladder several times. Your play is predictable and unproductive.
Woah, hey! To expand is to give mercy, barcode scum! Don’t be a hater.
You should aspire to more than rush builds and gimmicks. The meta no longer favors aggressive play.
Man, Mach, you didn’t tell me that this chick was so uptight. Is the rest of the team this lame?
Both of them rest their eyes on me, expectant. Now or never, I guess.
You won’t need to worry about lackluster teammates. Jett is actually the one who’s setting this whole thing up.
Jett?!
That's right.
With crossed arms, I beam a confident grin at the two of them. Stunt wears a mixture of surprise and excitement, while Reva seems to simply be processing the development.
But isn’t she on VIP?
For now. But she’s not happy with her practice environment or how much they’re paying her, so she’s not going to renew her contract at the end of the month.
Interesting.
Reva pushes her glasses against the bridge of her nose, silent. Stunt looks like he wants to simultaneously call me a liar and a genius.
How exactly did you end up recruiting for Jett? It’s not like she has any need for some mediocre foreigner.
Mediocre foreigner that slapped down your terrible cheese build, Stunt. And I’ll be the first to admit I’m lucky to sit where I am. The same is true for the two of you.
Practice hard and maybe we can make something of ourselves and this team. Sound good?
I’m in no way the captain of this squad, so it feels a little weird to take such an authoritative tone. Still, Stunt backs down and dons a thoughtful expression.
Yeah, alright. You’re right. This could be big.
I agree. Your offer had piqued my interest, but word that a player as accomplished as Jett will be among us has secured it. I will join.
Perfect. She’ll be happy to hear it. That leaves only the matter of a sponsor, which Jett is taking care of as we speak, and a coach.
We’ll obviously want to keep an eye out for anyone else with some talent… But for now, this is our roster.
The three of us share a long look at one another. Before any other thought can come to mind, Reva ends the silence.
What is the name of our team?
Oh. Uh. We haven’t picked one out yet.
That is troublesome. Should not such a thing been taken care of by now?
I really should have gotten around to asking Jett. Stunt shares in Reva’s indignation with a gesture towards her.
Thank you! We need to get this done already. How about we call ourselves the Lamenting Reapers?
The hell? What is it with this kid and terrible team names?
I’ll talk with Jett tonight, okay? All you guys need to do is practice and wait for the announcement. You also need to be prepared to move out.
It’s pretty short notice, but neither of them protest so it hopefully won’t be a problem. Stunt definitely lives with his mom... It’s harder to tell with Reva.
She seems to be about my age, maybe a bit younger. It’s possible she lives on her own.
Very well, as long as the matter is not being neglected. Was there more of importance to go over?
If not, I would prefer to return home. A PC bang is an improper practice environment.
Pft, you’re just a shut-in. Don’t deny it, it’s written all over you.
I am not. What right do you have—
But before she can say anything else, Stunt lurches forward, grabs Reva by the wrist, and begins dragging her towards the PCs.
If you’re going to live in our team house, you better get used to practicing next to other people.
Let me show you one of my favorite ‘unproductive’ builds.
Hours of games together serve the three of us well. Most professional gamers have a certain level of respect for someone that can put up strong matches, even if they don’t have great results. 
While Stunt and Reva have playstyles as wildly different as their personalities, both are formidable opponents.
Golden Zonefire’s peak time passed about an hour ago. While it’s not nearly as empty as it was when Reva arrived, there’s enough room that we have a relatively quiet section to ourselves.
Hey Reva, Accel told me that you know all three races. Why are you only playing terran?
Terran is the best choice given the current metagame. It is also the only race that earns one hundred percent of its wins.
Blunt, but I can’t deny her logic. Especially when she puts up such a strong match. She’s pretty biased when it comes to game balance, though.
I’ve got to say, Stunt’s unit control is ridiculously precise. It’s a shame he only puts it to use with his so-called innovative strategies.
Jett’s on her way with some good news, or so a text from her says. The only thing that’s keeping my mind off of her imminent arrival is the game between Stunt and Reva unfolding ahead of me.
Stunt’s going proxy two gate yet again. Reva scouted it four of the last five times he’s tried it. He’s just being stubborn at this point.
Still, the map is well-suited for the build, and he’s already managed to kill an SCV with some good probe micro.
Reva’s defense is formulaic as always. So far it’s working, but she’s in for a bit of a surprise after I sneak a glance at Stunt’s screen.
A half-dozen probes stream up Reva’s ramp and cut off an exit for the two marines kiting a pair of zealots.
The protoss units close the distance and slice the pair of marines to pieces, securing a massive advantage that Stunt carries into a victory.
Stunt pushes away from his monitor and stands, hands on his hips.
Easy!
Reva doesn’t let it faze her. She rotates in her chair and shrugs.
Unorthodox and inconsistent. But it worked, I will admit.
Stunt basks in the glory of victory for a moment longer before something behind me catches his attention.
I follow his gaze to find Jett and a man in a business suit walking towards us. He seems out of place dressed so well in a PC bang.
Mach and… Reva, right? This is Mr. Kim, VP of partnerships at Enoch Group. His company is looking to get into eSports.
The casual timbre of her voice and the pained look on her face says it all: Do not screw this up. I tighten up my posture and lower my head in a bow at the exec.
It’s nice to meet you, Mr. Kim. What does your company do?
... And realize too late that I probably shouldn't have admitted that I've never heard of Enoch.
Jett seethes through her teeth, but Mr. Kim takes my question with an easy smile and offers me his business card.
I give the card a brief once-over before placing it carefully in my pocket.
We’re in a handful of markets and offer a variety of business services. Consulting, marketing, and a few other things.
Oh. That sounds important.
And vague, though I don’t say that. Truth be told, I’m pretty much clueless when it comes to business related things.
Stunt and Reva’s deer-in-the-headlight silence isn’t exactly helping, either.
But it’s as Jett says. eSports is a fascinating industry with strong potential for continued growth. I'm particularly interested in strategic opportunities based on its unique qualities.
I’ve proposed the idea of sponsoring a fresh team to Enoch’s board, but for now we’re just shopping around.
He pauses to observe my reaction. I get a strong feeling that this guy is a pro at negotiation.
As if she suspects the very same thing, Jett steps forward to prevent me from saying anything that could take away her leverage.
As I said before, we’re still not ready to accept any offers. You have our interest, but we're keeping our options open for the time being.
Of course, there's no rush. I merely wanted the chance to introduce myself.
Mm. And we’ve got plenty to discuss. Thank you for the ride, Mr. Kim.
It was no trouble. We’ll be in touch.
And with that, the businessman departs just as quickly as he arrived. It’s only once he’s gone that I realize just how tense my shoulders are.
That guy looks like a secret agent or an insider. Can we name our team that? Secret Agentz?
Is this Stunt, Mach?
She thumbs in his direction and turns back to him when I nod.
Shut up, Stunt. We’re probably going to have to name our team after his company.
Man. I’ve been coming up with all kind of mascots and taglines... Team Enoch? That’s so lame.
With a sigh, Stunt sinks down in his chair. Jett does her best to ignore him.
So, these are the two you managed to pick up? Stunt and Reva. A cafe whelp and a ladder hero... and a literal 'who' foreigner.
The three of us don’t have anything to say to that, so she continues.
Alright, whatever. We’re going to make this work one way or another. All that’s left for us to do is recruit a coach.
Got anyone in mind?
Not particularly. VIP hasn’t exactly been great for networking outside of the team. They're pretty much done for as soon as I leave.
The ease with which she delivers that judgement leaves me taken aback.
I guess if she's going to sever ties with her old teammates, she can't afford to second guess herself. A brutal and unfortunate necessity.
How did you know Mr. Kim then?
We’ve only just met. I asked around if anyone knew of decent sponsorship opportunities, and an old Brood War friend pointed me in his direction.
Fortunate. A coach should be relatively easy to acquire with word that a sponsor is ready to back us.
Reva stares unblinking at no one in particular. It’s a little bit creepy just how calculating she looks.
Right. Anyway, I can handle the rest. You three just need to focus on practice, hear me?
Yup!
Yes.
Yeah.
Good. I’ll keep you posted on developments. If everything goes as planned, we’ll be registered and ready to rock by week’s end. The next VSTL starts two weekends after that.
The fire burning in Jett’s eyes is a refreshing sight. I can only promise so much to Stunt and Reva, but for them to see a proven player like Jett get behind the team has to be motivating.
I need to get back to the VIP team house. It’s about time I let them know that I’m not re-signing. Mach, give these two my number. Text me if you need something.
Before I can even respond, Jett is halfway to the door.
Rather than dwell on her words or sit in silence, Stunt bounds to his feet and clenches a fist forward.
You heard her, chumps! More practice!
I am afraid not. I must be getting home. Jett is not the only one with preparations to make.
Yeah, same. Don’t let us stop you, though.
Tch, fine. Let it be known that when I begged and pleaded for practice partners, I was cruelly denied by my own teammates.
Stunt’s theatrical complaints don’t end until I follow Reva out onto the street. Through the door’s window, he gives us a sour face and then returns to his PC.
He is a bit childish.
Well, he's still a kid.
The two of us start heading in the same direction by coincidence, though neither of us bring it up as we share simple conversation.
I ask about her build orders, and she asks me about foreign tournaments. Reva reacts with surprise when I inform her on the antics of foreign FPS pro-gamers.
Would shouting insults at each other mid-match not disrupt their ability to communicate?
No idea. All I know is that they get loud enough to hear from the open bracket area.
Curious.
Our small talk is cut short when she heads for a subway tunnel located along my route home.
But just before she descends the tile steps, Reva turns and offers a rare smile.
Goodbye, Mach. It was nice to meet you.
Bye. Catch you online.
When she’s gone, I’m left to think over the day’s events alone. Mr. Kim, Enoch... This is all too good to be true.
It feels right to be wary. Too many aspiring pro-gamers have had their fledgling careers dashed to pieces by stupid mistakes and broken promises. I can’t let myself be one of them.
Maybe I’ve earned the chance to rest, to congratulate myself.
But I won’t. Not yet.
Lately, the streets haven’t seemed so foreign or confusing.
It might just be because I stick to the same route every time I walk to Golden Zonefire, but I like to think I’ve really started to figure out life as a foreigner.
I’ve settled into a routine that works for me. A few hours of ladder in the morning, then I hang out at the cafe with whoever shows up that day.
Practice, talk strategy, maybe grab some food, and then we go our separate ways.
It’s enough to satisfy me, while still offering plenty of free time to keep from burning out. It’s not a champion’s regimen, but it should suffice. Hopefully.
Jett is always pushing me to practice longer, but it's hard to see the point. What's ten hours going to do for me that six hours doesn't?
I haven’t seen that Bolt guy at Golden Zonefire since I challenged him, luckily. I was anxious about the possibility of running into him again.
A confrontation when I’m supposed to be training is the last thing I need.
Familiar landmarks crop up one by one. It’s not long before the cafe comes into view, busy as it always is on the weekends.
I squeeze past a half dozen middle schoolers and make my way to our quiet corner.
Yo! What took ya? We’ve been waiting on you for sooooooo long.
Don’t listen to him. He got here just before you did.
Stunt scowls and sinks down in his chair. I try not to smile.
Reva’s a no-show again. Messaged me this morning that she wanted to stay in and ladder. Is Accel coming? I know Crash has team league tonight.
Nope. He mentioned that he has some last minute build prep to take care of. Who are they playing again?
KaiNE, I think.
Right.
There are a lot of advantages for players on a team. Recognition, housing, practice, salary—but getting to play in team league is one of the biggest perks, period.
A lot of young StarCraft talent breaks out in VSTL. Matches against top players are usually rare for those that aren't qualified for VSL, but not in team league.
For an amateur, a win there is more than a sign of good things to come.
Did Accel tell you anything about his team’s plan?
Jett shakes her head before successfully snatching Stunt’s phone out of his hand. She rolls it in the space between her fingers and turns back to me.
Don’t be so naive, Mach. Accel and I may be friends, but that sort of information isn’t something you can give away freely.
Stunt gropes for his phone, a pout set across his face. Jett dodges a few times before willingly relinquishing the device.
Stop ignoring us. It’s rude.
Tch, whatever. You quit lecturing Mach.
Their eyes battle briefly before Jett concedes, glancing away with a dismissive gesture. Stunt savors his fleeting victory with a grin before dropping the phone to the table.
It's rare to find someone willing to share their strategies openly. Maybe it’s different in the foreign scene, but not here.
I lost to an amazing one base all-in build on ladder a week back. Sent the guy a message asking for a few replays. He told me to kill myself.
You don't need to look so pleased about it. Sheesh.
However, there's one exception.
That being?
If a foreigner eliminates a Korean player, our scene will sometimes band together and send replays for his next opponent to study.
It's a matter of national pride at that point. Been that way since Brood War.
That's a rumor I've heard before. Replays can be invaluable in preparing for a specific player. What could be more useful than an exact recording of someone's strategies and tactics?
At least Jett has the courtesy to look vaguely apologetic. I nod, doing my best not to look too surprised.
How much do Korean players practice for team league? The same as the individual leagues or...?
Depends. Not less, if they aren't taking home at least top eight in solo league. StarCraft may be a one on one game, but teams can't always be sponsored on the backs of individuals.
Don’t think that gives you the right to neglect your solo league. Admittedly, VSTL is secondary to VSL. If any of you fail to qualify, I’ll make you a slave of my practice house.
Cool your jets, Jett, and have a little confidence in us.
When you inspire confidence, I will. Remind me again how you placed in the last qualifier?
Stunt wrinkles his nose and takes the opportunity to return to his cell phone game. Even between teammates, StarCraft’s competitive nature thrives.
Silence lingers until I decide to speak up, if only to break the tension.
Why don’t we go watch Accel play tonight? I’m sure he’ll appreciate the support.
They simultaneously glance up at me, and then at each other. More silence.
I’m just about ready to give up when Jett speaks.
That's a good idea. I've been meaning to speak with Accel anyway.
Sounds like fun. Let’s bet on the games, though.
Gambling? I shouldn't be surprised. You play protoss, after all.
Twenty-five thousand on Crash.
Hah! I’ll take that bet any day.
Wait, I’m not done. Twenty-five thousand won on Crash. But if Accel all-kills, you pay double.
Stunt pauses, chewing over the odds with a contorted look on his face. All-kills are incredibly rare. It’s hard enough for one player to single-handedly defeat more than one opponent, let alone an entire team.
With his decision made, Stunt slams a fist down hard enough to draw a few glances from a nearby table.
Deal. The match won’t be for another few hours, so you’ll have plenty of time to regret your mistake while I’m kicking your ass.
I wanna try out this new build making the rounds called the two-base immortal all-in. It crushes zerg, or they're saying on the forums.
Let’s go. Hey Mach, come watch and learn a thing or two about how to PvZ like a pro.
That's useless to me. And I need to message Reva anyway. She’s gotta come—
He doesn’t wait for me to finish my thought before bolting for an open PC. I’m left with Jett, who takes her time in joining Stunt.
He’s funny.
Funny doesn’t win games.
Jett seems conspicuously pensive as she rises to head over to a machine. Just as she turns to leave, she stops and looks back at me.
Mach. Do you think that teammates have to be friends?
Eh? What do you mean?
The question is straightforward. Yes or no, do teammates need to be friends?
What? Of course they should. Why wouldn’t you be friends with the people you live and practice with?
It’s not that simple. What are you supposed to do if your teammate can’t perform and needs to be replaced?
What if your friendship keeps you from offering honest criticism, the type that hurts to hear?
Nobody is expected to be friends with their coworkers at an office job. You act cordial and work together to get something done. That’s it. There’s no reason that eSports should be any different.
It’s not the same. Can you honestly say that you’d be as motivated to turn around a losing set for a bunch of strangers than for your friends?
... Hmph. You’re not being realistic.
Err. Teammates should be civil, but it isn’t necessary that they be friends.
I agree. The goals of a friendship and the goals of a team don’t always align. It can complicate things and make life more difficult for everyone.
If only more people saw it that way. eSports isn't a game for people afraid to face the real world.
Too many losers retreat to StarCraft and expect everything outside of the game to be easy and fun. People like that aren't cut out for eSports. Or anything, really.
In any case, you did well to recruit Stunt and Reva. I appreciate it.
I’ll take care of the rest. Be around Golden Zonefire every single day for the next week or so. And practice. Practice a lot.
She answers my nod by taking off in Stunt's direction.
Where is she? After all it took to convince her, Reva better not have changed her mind without telling me. Maybe she's the type to always be running late.
This is the first time I've been back at the VSL studio since the qualifier. Reva's not the only one who feels out of place.
I'm just about to send her another text when I catch the top of her head coming up the stairs.
Get lost in the subway again?
My apologies. This is my first time at the VSL studio.
Oh. Really? You've never tried to qualify or come to spectate?
She shakes her head. That's a huge surprise, considering she's local.
It's easy enough to follow the VSL online, but nothing beats the live experience. Watching the round of four in person was one of the first things I did here in Seoul.
Jett and Stunt are probably waiting for us. C'mon.
Nearly every seat in the spectator area of the VSL studio is taken. It’s only with a wave from Jett that Reva and I are ushered past the back rows and into our seats over on the side.
Stunt is seated beside Jett and acknowledges us with a smile. With how differently the four of us are dressed, it’d be hard for anyone to tell that we’re actually a team.
Well, I guess technically we’re not a team yet. Not officially, anyway. With the thought on my mind, I look to Jett and keep my voice low.
Do we have a uniform planned?
Oh, hell yeah! I want a team jacket.
The uniform we pick comes out of the team's warchest. It’s stupid for us to splurge when we don't have any results.
Stunt’s longing stare doesn’t fade away until Jett focuses a glare in his direction.
The production crew is busy at work behind the scenes. There are way more VSL staff members than the stream lets on.
People with clipboards and headsets pace the studio frantically, moving from team benches to behind the booths and then back again.
Accel sits on the end of the bench with the rest of Crash. Their coach, a balding man with small eyes, a red nose, and a clip on tie, paces back and forth with his hands in the pockets of his blazer.
Most coaches are usually retired players or have management experience. This guy has got either the latter or nothing—it wouldn’t surprise me to learn that he’s never played a game of StarCraft in his life.
The players of Team KaiNE sit on the opposite side of the studio. Their coach is far more subdued and one that I actually recognize: An old B-tier Brood War pro that aged out of his ability to compete.
Stunt leans over Jett to whisper something,
 but before he can open his mouth, the Victory StarLeague's theme song cuts in to announce that the broadcast is about to get started.
Korean StarLeagues have a weird fascination with alt rock. The same songs from my embarrassing freshman year playlist blast unabashedly to stadiums of eSports fans.
The crowd’s cheers die down only once the commentators give their introductions. When I look over my shoulder, I can see the table where they keep the two English casters.
The duo is loved more for their laidback banter than their game analysis, not that it's anything I'd change.
There’s no way for me to hear them without getting a headpiece that'll make me look like a tourist. I'll have to settle for the Korean commentators.
Welcome to the VSTL! Today's first match is an exciting duel between Crash and KaiNE.
Ah, both are very solid teams that have been around from the very beginning of StarCraft 2. I am eager to see whether or not they show us good games.
This is the furthest that KaiNE has been since the beginning of the StarCraft 2 team league. Crash will need to make it to VSTL finals if they wish to share that accomplishment!
Indeed! They have a challenging path ahead of them, but I am certain that they are capable of returning to their former glory.
My thoughts are the same. Only one of KaiNE's players remains in the VSL, so they should have had plenty of time to practice for this match. Can the same be said for Crash?
Certainly so. Crash's lineup is well-tested and proven in the VSL. It's a sure bet that they have not neglected to prepare accordingly.
... Well. There won't be any jokes about cartoons from the 90s, but I should stay pretty well informed throughout the series.
An array of multicolored overhead lights announce the first match. Polished motion graphics and meticulously collected player statistics whiz around the display at the front of the studio.
The VSL studio really has hype-building down to a science.
Who do you think Crash is going to send out first, Jett?
Not Accel, unless they want him getting sniped right off the bat.
I nod. A common strategy in team league is to have a mid-tier player spend all of his practice time preparing specifically for one heavy hitter.
There are other things to take into account too, like the map or remaining opponents. But there’s no doubt that Team KaiNE has one of their players ready to take down Accel.
By the time I glance back up at the stage, the first two players are headed into the booths. Accel remains on the bench, eyes set on the same screen as the crowd.
It is starting.
Sure enough, once the players have their settings prepared and the coaches give the go-ahead, the match begins.
Luckily, Stunt has the sense not to gloat about the money that he just won from Jett.
The four of us sit in silence as we watch Accel agonize over his loss. 
While KaiNE is huddled together with smiles and cheers, all of Crash sit with their heads down save Accel, who still hasn’t left the booth.
His coach looks furious. He barges in through the booth’s back door and raves at Accel from behind his back.
I can’t believe what I’m seeing. Frustration is one thing, but Accel won two games before he went out.
Even if he had gone down without a win, there’s no reason to yell at him. How is that supposed to help?
Just as my anger on Accel’s behalf reaches the point that I think to say something to Jett, Accel rises from his seat and slides past his coach without so much as a glance in his direction.
Should we go talk to him?
Yeah. C’mon.
The three Korean commentators are in the middle of winding down the series with post-match analysis when we rise and exit through the studio’s backdoor.
We find Accel standing alone with a palm on his forehead. When he catches our footsteps, Accel turns to regard us all with his typical grin.
I lost. Oh well.
His carefree attitude is unique among professional gamers. If the average pro isn't angry or depressed by a loss, they’re at least frustrated.
Part of me wonders whether or not Accel is covering up his true feelings, but he seems genuinely fine.
Bad luck, Accel. You played well.
Yeah. Thanks.
What’s the deal with your coach? He seemed really upset with you.
Accel scoffs, allowing the disgust in his voice to show on his face.
He’s useless, especially considering that I do his job for team league. Busted my ass preparing for tonight—picked out the builds and the snipers and everything. Drilled the team for more than a week.
And your coach has laid the blame for the loss at your feet.
Accel nods and glances away. Spectators begin filtering out of the studio, offering us curious looks as they head outside. Looks like the studio is done for the night.
It’s ridiculous. And not a single person on Crash had the guts to back me up. I didn’t switch from Brood War to suffer spineless teammates and a coach with an ongoing mid-life crisis.
And you shouldn’t have to. Accel, ditch Crash and come coach for us.
Four pairs of eyes land on Jett, all but Reva’s bewildered. Accel recovers quickly before crossing his arms.
You know I can’t. I have a contract. It’s not up until next year.
A player contract, one that bars you from playing in StarLeagues for any team but Crash.
Even so, I can’t break the terms. I'm required to play for them. They can take legal action against me if I don't.
And you will, if they insist on it. Live, train, and coach at our team house. All you have to do is show up once a week to play your matches at the studio, and Crash can’t do anything.
Reva pushes her glasses up against the bridge of her nose, pensive. Stunt stares wide-eyed, as if a pivotal scene in a drama is playing out. As for me…
We could really use you, Accel. You deserve better.
... If I do this and the team doesn’t work out, my career is over.
He says it as much to himself as he does the rest of us. It’s true, and probably true for everyone else as well.
Accel stares at the floor for a while, deep in thought. When he finally looks up, it’s with a casual shrug.
Screw it. I’ve put off my mandatory military training for too long anyway. I’m down.
Stunt lets loose an ear-shattering cheer and flings his arms into the air. Reva's glasses nearly fall off in surprise, though she manages to catch them by the frame.
HELL YEAH! TEAM ENOCH NUMBAH ONE!!!
What a motley crew. A cafe whelp, a ladder hero, a no-name foreigner, and now some laidback hyung.
You forgot the washed-up champ.
Try as she might, Jett can’t hide the satisfied grin showing on her face. Everything has really come together.
This is it. This is what I came to Korea for. The months of endless ladder, the late-night online tournaments. I’m on a team. A real team.
We need to celebrate.
Oh, you want to treat the team? How kind of you, Mach.
Jett glances around to see if her quip earned a laugh, only to find Accel wagging a finger at her.
Have you already forgotten who convinced you to take the risk and form your own team? I’d say that’s worth a bottle of soju or two. Or ten.
Tch.
Jett brings a finger to her lip, either considering which bar to take us to or how to get out of paying.
Alright, enjoy the hell out of tonight. It’ll be the last time until we’ve got a championship trophy that we celebrate anything. Got that?
Good choice.
HELL YEAH!
Understood.
With a nod from Jett, the five of us walk shoulder to shoulder in high spirits. But just as we’re about to descend the stairs, Jett pauses.
Wait. Accel. Do you need to go talk to your team or anything?
That stops the rest of us in our tracks. We turn and find Accel at complete ease.
Nah. I'll take care of it later.
With a knowing smile, he leads us down the stairs and out onto the street.
The bar that Jett had in mind was halfway across the city, though after a subway ride it doesn’t take us more than thirty minutes to arrive. 
The trendy-looking lounge is packed with twentysomethings, most of them older than even Accel.
Stunt walks ahead of us with a swagger, noting with pride on the way over to our table that he has a fake-id and goes to bars all the time.
With who, your mom?
With your mom, bitch!
My mom is in the U.S. though.
Oh, her flight landed already?
I can’t help but laugh. Stunt is incredibly immature, even for his age. But there’s something undeniably uplifting about his enthusiasm.
With all of the booths full, we pick out a table close to an empty dance floor. It’s cramped with the five of us, but we make do.
Man, I can’t remember the last time I went out like this. Spent so much of this year cooped up in the Crash team house.
Mm. Same. VIP’s mandatory hours were brutal by Star2 standards. No one even made good use of them.
A scruffy waiter dressed no differently than the bar’s patrons stops by to take our drink orders before Stunt can return to bragging about his iron stomach.
Jett shows three fingers for the number of soju bottles she wants. With a click of his tongue, the waiter departs with our order in hand.
There’s five of us though, Jett.
You think I can’t count? You don’t drink soju from the bottle.
Oh. Well, I’ve never had it before.
That is not a surprise. Soju is unpopular outside of Korea.
We’ll show you how to do it right, Mach.
While awaiting the server's return, I notice Accel glancing repeatedly in Reva's direction.
Mach, what ended up happening with Reva? And who's our friend here?
.........
I am Reva! And, allow me to say that it is a great pleasure to meet you in person!
 Your play has been.....
 an inspiration......... to..... m...e...
Uh. Is Reva an Accel fangirl? She'd have been maybe fifteen at the prime of his Brood War career...
Well. A shame that these punks didn't have the decency to introduce us properly. It's nice to finally meet you, Reva.
No lie, your mech is the best I've seen outside of VSL. You've got to show me the timings on your double armory build at some point.
Y-You too.
I think he broke her. It's okay Reva, I've been there.
Reva manages to (mostly) pull herself out of her fangirl shock by the time our waiter returns.
When he's gone, Accel pours out a shot-glass worth of soju and hands it to me.
Go on. In one gulp.
There isn’t much liquid in the glass, so I throw it back without a second thought. It takes a few seconds for my tastebuds to react.
Ugh, this stuff is awful. It’s all I can do not to retch.
It’s... good...
How does a guy learn Korean without coming across soju at least once? It's kind of impressive, actually.
I learned online. Wasn't ever a part of my lessons, I guess.
That is one of the most difficult ways to learn a language. How did you manage?
K-pop and StarCraft. They didn’t offer Korean as a language option at my high school, so I studied it in my spare time.
K-pop? Disgusting. I knew you were Koreaboo scum.
At least I did something useful with my dumb hobbies. Can you say the same? How's your English?
...
<H-Hello! I am Stunt! Protoss! I am one!>
<Very bad. Used two names to help, and said lies. Bad student and player needs to work harder.>
Reva asks for my approval with a look. I give it with a nod.
Bad what? What'd she say, Mach?
Bad luck. You were almost perfect.
Hah! Knew it, I'm a natural.
I pour out a shot for Accel, relieved when the culture test is over. Jett's three bottles are soon emptied and then replaced.
The soju-fueled conversations range from StarCraft and team houses to fashion and college, and whatever else in between.
You three are so lucky. Korean guys drop two of our golden years on the military! It’s totally unfair! Tell 'em, Accel!
Stunt points at Jett, me, and then Reva. Neither of them seem particularly ruffled.
Accel only watches, slightly drunk and highly entertained.
I would gladly spend two years in our military to reap the benefits of your gender.
Seriously. Do you have any idea how uncomfortable being pressured into some braindead photoshoot with a pink keyboard is?
'Smile agasshi! Headphones don't sell themselves you know! Why don't you lose the team jacket and pull down your shirt a bit? Oh, I want to see you with double eyelids by next time!'
It's just like that. Literally the worst.
... Dear god. Jett, please, never do that again.
Sponsors pay you to sit in front of a camera. How terrible!
Don’t tell me that there aren’t advantages for girls in eSports! It’s SO much easier to get on a team, and you get way more fans!
You cannot understand without experiencing it firsthand, so you only see the good.
Come on, Mach! Back me up here.
I mean, what he’s saying is true. Women don't have to be as good at the game to get noticed by teams or sponsors.
That is such bullshit. The types of girls you’re talking about aren’t even really players. They’re mascots. Just there to bring attention to their teams.
Just like you, Mach.
Making up for all the times you were bullied in school, are we? Jeez.
The give and take is not in our favor. I find it easier to avoid disclosing my gender entirely.
Don’t waste your breath, Mach. There’s no convincing these two.
It’s hard for everyone, Stunt. But you have to admit that girls trying to make it in eSports have to worry about things that guys don’t give a second thought.
Psh. Like?
When I was an amateur back in Brood War, some gross KPGA pen-pusher said he’d help me get my pro license if I spent the night at his place. I had just turned 17.
All of our eyes shift to Jett, surprised—though Stunt’s most of all. I take a moment to silently appreciate that StarCraft 2 doesn’t require a pro license to play in StarLeagues.
... Did you do it?
NO! What the hell is wrong with you!?
Jett snatches her glass off the table and snaps her arm back. When Stunt recoils and shrinks beneath the table, she returns her drink to her lips with a satisfied smirk.
Is it a crime to wonder?!
Accel drops his fist to the table with thump, ending the argument and earning our attention.
We are going to play a drinking game.
Why?
Why? Because we’re about to condemn ourselves to lives of timing attacks, hard contains, and positional play.
We’ve got one night to get hammered and we’re going to make the most of it.
You’ve convinced me. What do you want to play?
Oh! Let’s play the King’s Game!
Shut up. The King’s Game is for desperate teenagers.
She glances over Stunt and offers a smile to make her point.
Nah, nah. Chopsticks. It’s really simple. I say something that might describe one of us more than the others, and we point at who we think what’s said describes best.
Eh. I don’t follow.
Okay, it’s like this: Which of us is most likely to hate soju?
Accel takes a chopstick from the table and points it at me, as do Jett, Reva, and Stunt.
And then you drink. But we won’t count that one.
Oh. That makes sense.
Mhm. Why don’t you start us off with a few?
Which of us is most likely to end up a NEET?
Four sets of chopsticks immediately fall onto Reva. One of her sticks slips out from between her fingers and onto the floor.
M-Me?
C’mon, you give off a powerful shut-in vibe.
I do not understand.
You’re doing it right now! It’s like you learned how to communicate from a text-to-speech program.
Reva, what do you like besides games and eSports? Do you have any hobbies?
... I watch anime.
... Anything else?
.............
See.
Jett is doing her best to keep from piling on, but the urge is evident on her face.
But I have StarCraft, so I cannot be a NEET. That should be considered employment.
Sure, but the question was who was most likely. If you washed out of professional gaming, I could totally see you as an MMO addict.
I have max level characters in the most popular three, but that does not qualify me as an addict on its own.
God. How? Those games are disgustingly grindy. You really aren’t helping your case.
Okay, answer this: What StarCraft community site do you read and post on the most?
It is an imageboard.
Drink, Reva.
Which of us is most likely still a virgin?
Before he can even react, Accel, Jett, and I point our chopsticks in Stunt’s direction. He jumps in his seat, aghast.
He senses weakness in Reva and aims his answer towards her, only to have her repay the favor.
THIS IS BULLSHIT!
Calm down. You’re like, what. Twelve?
You guys have NO idea! I’m a playa, you hear me?
Doubtful.
You were hanging out with middle schoolers at a PC bang when I found you. Be honest with us.
Stunt scrunches up his face, allowing his rage to stew momentarily before bursting out with another protest.
This is a rigged question. You guys all have like, at least four years of extra time to luck out.
Virginity confirmed. Drink.
Oh, cut the kid some slack. It’d be kinda weird if he wasn’t.
A breach of trust! Ethically unsound! Harassment on an unreasonable scale!
He makes a box on the table with his finger, continuing his exaggerated and antiquated protests all the while.
This is a no bullying area. If you enter the DMZ, I will retaliate with full force.
Which of us has the worst fans?
Pft, it’s not like anyone but Accel and I even—
Jett’s train of thought shatters when she notices four chopsticks pointed in her direction.
What!?
Defiantly, Jett aims her own at Accel. He merely grins in response.
Be honest. When was the last time you had a meet and greet session where some fanboy didn’t slobber all over you?
Your brusque attitude attracts a certain type of fan, Jett.
What’s that supposed to mean?
It means they like it when you call someone trash! C’mon, you’re the one that gives those blunt pre-game interviews.
I simply say what’s on my mind. If that happens to be how confident I am, then so what? And what does that have to do with my fans?
Let’s put it like this. Reva, what would you say to the crowd before a big finals match?
I would like to thank my fans for cheering for me. I have worked hard to improve my condition and will send my opponent to Andromeda. I promise to show you good games.
So you'll get earnest supporters that love to see you do well.
But Jett, your fans want you to lose almost as much as they want you to win.
That’s absurd. People that cheer for my losses aren’t my fans.
Whatever you want to call them, they’re yours and yours alone. Don't pretend like you don't know what we're talking about.
I have plenty of very nice and well-intentioned fans. You’re just focusing on the minority of terrible ones.
Oh, like the guy who brought a bodypillow with your picture to an autograph session? How could I forget!
Jett’s expression flashes a mixture of anger and embarrassment. She looks ready to throw a punch.
GOD DAMMIT ACCEL, I TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT IN CONFIDENCE.
IF ANY OF YOU EVER BRING THIS UP AGAIN, YOU DIE.
..................
... There's no way I'm asking. I'm smarter than that.
Jett seethes in displeasure at Accel. He's trying hard to keep from cracking up.
... Did you sign it?
Without consciously realizing it, I find myself dodging something.
Jett's shotglass whizzes past my head and shatters on the wall behind me. From across the room, a few of the bar’s patrons laugh drunkenly at the absurdity.
She reaches for another, apparently intent on making sure she gets her point across. I’m left with no choice but to raise my hands and surrender.
I don’t need to know! I don’t need to know!
She sets the glass down and looks away from the rest of us, still hot-faced from the negative attention.
Which of us is the most likely to bang a fan?
Rushing right out the gate, are we? You’re supposed to do a few more warm up questions before you to get to the raunchy stuff.
You say that only because you know you’re going to lose this one.
Despite finding himself staring down four pairs of chopsticks, Accel never loses his easygoing smile.
I freely admit I’ve slept with one of my fans before. This question is more like winning than losing anyway since I'm not a lech.
Do you have a story to go along with it?
Pretty much what you’d expect. This one girl used to show up to all my Brood War matches. She cheered for me, brought gifts, and led the fanchants. Managed my fanclub too.
I was knocked out of a StarLeague pretty early a few years back. She was the only person that showed up to my meet and greet afterwards.
I asked her if she’d like to go to dinner, and she said yes. It went from there. We dated for more than a year. Had to break it off when she went abroad for university.
Ah, now you’ve got me feeling nostalgic. Thanks, Mach.
What a beautiful story.
It’s hard to tell if the complete lack of emotion in Reva’s voice is intentional.
I know those kind of fans. They’re always like, ‘oh, when I imagine him practicing all day, my heart aches and I want to make him hot soups!’
Literally no one has said or ever will say that.
They’re gonna be saying it when I take my place as the protoss bonjwa. Can't wait to have my legion of loyal fangirls called Stunt's C—
A well-timed hiccup stops Stunt in his tracks. He laughs obnoxiously when his head hits the table.
Someone should really confiscate this kid's fake.
We finish out our game of chopsticks with a slew of highly inappropriate questions and equally bold answers.
I like soju way more in my stomach than on my lips. Though, I’m not sure I’ll feel the same way in the morning.
Our celebration goes late into the night, long enough that we’re practically the only patrons left. 
A tendril of drool collects at the corner of an unconscious Stunt's lip. Reva’s eyes are unfocused behind her glasses.
But while there’s a bit extra to Accel’s typical grin, both he and Jett look as collected as ever.
Dude… it’s late.
Accel pulls the phone out of Stunt's pocket and checks the time.
Oh. It is.
He then replaces the expensive-looking electronic on the young protoss player’s head.
Jett, the next time you travel for a European tournament, make sure you show up to the afterparty.
Say what you will about their play, but those guys know how to have a good time.
Pass. I go for easy prize money, not discotec with Lars and Jørgen.
You guys ready to leave?
Yeah. Should, if we don’t want to wake up after noon.
This is the worst part of every night out. How the hell are we supposed to get Stunt home?
Don’t forget Jett, the bill is all yours.
Aaaaaaaaaaaah... Why’d you remind me?
I can hail a cab for Stunt, I guess.
Thank you for treating us to dinner, Jett.
Now there’s a terran that knows how to manner-up. It’s probably because she can play zerg. Take note, boys.
Reva, you alright? Need any help getting home?
Oh. Hm. I would not mind assisting you in returning Stunt to—
Denied. You're on your own, Mach. Need to talk team business with Reva.
Oh. Right then.
I'm out, stuff to do. Later team.
With a salute, Accel makes his way out of the bar. I’m left to wake Stunt while Jett speaks hushedly to Reva.
Kid. Wake up. I’m taking you home.
.................................................................................................. Huhwhat?
I brace myself and, after pocketing Stunt’s phone off of his head, heave him onto his feet. He’s light, which makes the effort easier than I was expecting. Jett calls after me as we go.
Don’t dump him in an alley. We need a protoss.
Yeah, yeah.
I practically carry Stunt outside, offering the bar’s patrons and staff a shameless smile as I make my way through the doorway.
It doesn’t take much effort to hail a cab and pitch the underaged-drinker inside. Once I’ve made room for myself, I climb in and close the door.
I wake to the taste of stale soju on my breath. My apartment is mostly dark, save the crack of light coming through my window.
It takes a great deal of effort to dredge myself out of bed, but the need to rinse my mouth is enough motivation.
The first time I ever drank too much, I swore to myself I’d never touch alcohol again.
Even if that was a pledge I knew that I wouldn’t keep, it seems like I won’t get another chance to for a while now.
Well, at least until there’s a trophy in our team house.
Without any idea where Stunt's house was, I had the cab drop him off at Stomping Grounds. The last thing I remember was a glare capable of killing small animals from his mother.
I return from the sink with a glass of water and fall into my computer chair. It’s too early for ladder, but I might see what's going on——
Wait a second. WHAT?
Oh my god. Accel, what did you do?
Every StarCraft fansite is abuzz with the news that Jett and Accel are ditching their teams. Accusations of collusion, conspiracy, and corruption abound among Korean and Western fans alike.
A laundry list of the Crash coach's missteps ranks second to an interview where he shifts the blame onto Accel. With the scent of drama in the air, debate rages wildly on both sides.
When Accel said he had a better idea in mind, I had no idea he meant something like this. Jett’s new team is the talk of the entire StarCraft community.
I rush into the game client, abusing the login button with a dozen clicks a second until I'm finally in. Accel is online, as is the rest of our team.
Before I can even open a chat window, an invite from Jett throws me into an underway group conversation.
Text messages appear almost as quickly as I can read them.
what the hell is wrong with you!?
heyhey relax. you know what they say about publicity
LOOOOOOL HOLY SHIT DUDE THIS IS HILARIOUS ROFL
Word that Stunt, Mach and I are joining is out. I’ve received multiple requests for interviews.
you should do it
you don’t understand! the deal with enoch wasn’t official, this is going to screw us!
heyhey. I didn’t mention enoch by name. just finish the deal and we’ll be fine
yeah, what’s stopping that kim dude from signing us? accel is kind of right. we have buzz going now.
KEKEKEKEKEKEKEKEK
they're saying i poached you! couldn’t you have gotten back at your coach some other way???
nop. and I’ll get back at him more when I stomp Crash in team league
It would be prudent to speak with Mr. Kim as soon as possible, Jett.
I KNOW. UGH. ok, we’re meeting at namdan asap, the park by the VSL studio. everyone. no exceptions.
KK LOLL
The diamond next to Jett’s portrait changes from green to black. Accel quickly follows suit and then Stunt, leaving me in the chatroom alone with Reva.
be fast, jett’ll blow up your phone with texts otherwise.
I will. Goodbye.
With nothing else keeping me at home, I hurry to shut off my PC and dress. I take the stairs of my apartment building two at a time and make my way onto the street.
What a mess. How terrible would it be to have spent all of last night celebrating for nothing?
Truth be told, whether Accel leaked the information now or let it come out on its own, we’d eventually get this reaction.
Enoch wouldn’t have signed us without doing proper background research anyway. Maybe it's alright for this to be out in the open ahead of time.
I set those thoughts aside when Namdan Park comes into view. The crowded treeline and trimmed green is a welcome departure from Seoul’s endless concrete.
Jett didn’t specify where at the park she wanted us to meet, but it doesn’t take long before I find her staring down a seated Accel.
She’s in the middle of chewing him out, though it'd be hard to tell by the grin he’s wearing.
Have you seen what they’re saying online?!
The team has to stand out somehow. Better this than limping into scene and wallowing in obscurity.
We should stand out by winning games, not by stirring up shit. This wasn't your decision to make.
Accel’s the first to notice my arrival and waves me over. Jett’s acknowledgement follows, though it’s far less welcoming.
Did you know he was going to pull something like this?
What? No.
Relax, Jett. Seriously. Worrying will give you grey hairs.
I’ll relax the moment that I’m staring at a contract for six months of funding.
Jett’s stance goes rigid at the buzz of her phone. She rips it out of her pocket and stares at the screen.
Who is it?
Kim. He wants us to meet at the Enoch office to sort out this mess.
That’s a good thing, right? He wouldn’t bother to have us come out if the answer is going to be no.
She doesn’t seem to agree given the time it takes her to reply. I share a glance with Accel before Jett shoves the phone back into her pocket and turns to me.
We need to get moving. Accel, wait here for Stunt and Reva.
Fine by me.
Accel takes in a deep breath and returns to his bench, no doubt happy to relax while someone else handles the stress of a meeting.
I’m coming with you?
I’m not enough of a jerk to leave Stunt and Reva alone at the park for an hour, but I need someone at my back.
When you put it that way, alright.
Then come on. It’s not that far.
Without a moment to spare, Jett storms off.
Accel offers me a leisurely wave as I hurry after her.
Stunt is right.
Jett and Reva are right.
Let me do most of the talking, but chime in if it makes sense.
Alright.
Nervous?
No.
Don't lie to me. I’m nervous. It's fine to be nervous.
I’m fine.
When elevator door opens, a well-dressed Enoch employee greets us with a smile and gestures down the hall.
Mr. Kim has been anticipating your arrival. This way, please.
I follow Jett through a typical corporate office. Inside, a table seats Mr. Kim, his attention set on a laptop.
He glances past the screen to acknowledge us with a beckon forward.
Jett, Mach. Please, sit.
We take our seats opposite him. The secretary closes the board room’s door, leaving the three of us on our own.
After a few more taps on his laptop’s touchscreen, Mr. Kim turns the computer towards us and gestures sharply to it.
What is this?
On display is the comment section of a popular Korean eSports news site. Line after line portrays Jett and Accel as shady and unskilled.
... And I thought that the English sites were bad. Before I can read another comment, Mr. Kim forces the laptop shut with a grimace.
When I spoke of my interest to sponsor your team with the board, most were hesitant to take the risk even with my assurance that the investment would be worth it in the end.
Given the recent developments, I'll simply have to retract my recommendation and take the hit to my reputation. Your team has become a liability without having played a single game.
He rests a finger on his brow, expression fraught. This is worse than Jett and I planned for.
Do you have anything to say?
This wasn’t the reaction that we were hoping for. But it shows that people are paying attention to us.
Not all attention is created equal. What is most important is that an Enoch team has a large number of supporters. Not slack-jawed or passive observers. Fans that are invested in the team's victory.
You’ll immediately have five people invested in an Enoch squad if you sign us.
Through narrowed eyes, Mr. Kim shifts his eyes in my direction.
Mach. I should say that you are a large part of the doubt plaguing a possible sponsorship deal.
I blink once, taken aback. Me?
Are you truly surprised? Your ability is completely unproven. While Accel and Jett may have their integrity questioned, it’s you whom the fans mock.
If our fanbase doesn't have faith in your ability to win games, then of what use are you?
What?! I’m a good player! I just need time to prove it.
Time that you haven’t earned.
I hear myself tripping over my next protest. Right then, Jett cuts in.
Mr. Kim, there must be something that we can do. Accel and I are high profile. Even with a rocky start, we both have loyal fans that will follow us to a new team.
That may be so, but the public perception of Mach remains an issue. Is it worth the trouble of keeping him on when your reputation has been compromised?
He links his fingers together and glances between the two of us, awaiting an answer.
Jett closes her eyes and runs a hand through her hair. She takes a long moment to decide on what to say next, much to Mr. Kim's interest.
We could arrange something to fix that.
Oh? Elaborate.
A showmatch. The perfect chance to showcase Mach’s ability to compete.
Against someone from your team? Fans will assume that the match is fixed on his behalf.
No. I have someone else in mind. Someone who StarCraft fans know and respect, and that Mach owes a beating.
She turns towards and locks eyes with me. Is she talking about…?
A showmatch with Bolt? I mean…
You’re not allowed to turn this down.
I wasn’t planning on it. Just, how are you going to get him to agree?
I know Bolt well. He’ll jump at the chance to publicly humiliate someone he doesn’t like.
A best of five will do nicely. And I think it would be fair for Enoch to put half a month’s worth of team funding in as the prize, wouldn’t you say?
Jett turns away from me and towards Mr. Kim. For the first time since we stepped in the room, the businessman cracks a smile.
If you ever decide to leave StarCraft behind, you're welcome to interview for any open sales positions at Enoch, Jett.
Very well. If Mach is victorious in this showmatch, I will consider your team’s reputation redeemed.
I don’t bother asking what will happen if I lose. God, what did I do to deserve this pressure?
Would you mind speaking with the producers at the VSL studio to see if they would be willing to host us? A week from today is short notice, but we don't have any longer to waste.
I’ll have it done.
You’re very lucky to have someone like Jett as your team captain, Mach.
When I don't respond, he smirks.
Satisfied, Kim rises from his leather office chair. Jett and I quickly follow suit and exchange handshakes with him.
As he meets his palm with mine, Mr. Kim leans forward and whispers to me.
For the record, I would greatly prefer to see you succeed. Don’t let a mistake in the next week end your career before it's begun.
Nonchalantly, he parts from our grip and departs the conference room with long strides. His secretary skitters after him down the hallway, leaving Jett and me to find our own way back to the elevator.
Well, you came to Golden Zonefire looking for a chance. Now you’ve got one. Happy?
You stuck up for me.
Yes. And?
I just... I guess I thought that you'd have done what was best for the team.
Who said I'm not? Mr. Kim? I don't recall putting him in charge of team management.
What kind of team captain would I be if I tossed you out onto the street after recruiting Stunt and Reva?
I don't know. You said yourself that you wouldn't put the goals of a friendship ahead of the goals of your team.
Oh, in that case, it's not too late for me to go tell Mr. Kim I've changed my mind.
If you insist on paying me back, do so by practicing hard and beating the shit out of Bolt. It's been way too long since I've seen him lose in person.
And, for the record, I know what I said. But the more I think about it, the more messed up it seems that we’d waste our careers with people we hate.
So, for now, I've decided that I like you. Don’t make me regret that.
So much for cold efficiency. And I'll do my best.
As is expected of anyone that wears my team's colors.
Now c'mon. Before someone mistakes Accel for a bum.
Just before the elevator doors close, Mr. Kim turns the corner of his office and watches us go.
My legs are sore by the time we make it back to Namdan. Weeks of huddling up in my apartment obviously hasn’t been great for my personal fitness.
I catch sight of Stunt by his wild hair. He's the first to notice Jett and me and calls at us with a wave.
Yoooooooo! Is the team dead?
Not yet, and not for a while if our plan works out.
Accel sits up from his reclined position, while Reva has hardly moved at all since she came into view.
Plan?
Mach is going to win a showmatch.
Reva takes hold of her glasses, gears visibly turning in her head as she works out the point of a showmatch. Accel and Stunt simply look to me for the answer.
Mr. Kim agreed to sponsor us if we can redeem the team's image. I have to win a series against Bolt.
Bolt? That surly protoss on Shock? He's a Brood War player, though.
He plays Star2 on his own time. With money and the chance to embarrass a foreigner on the line, he has to accept.
And you’re okay with this, Mach?
Accel glances in my direction, genuine concern etched in his expression. He seems to be picking up on the doubt I’m feeling.
Yeah. Of course. I mean, I’m going to practice as hard as I can for the next week.
As will Bolt.
I don’t have anything to say to that. She’s right, after all.
The five of us take a moment to reflect on the severity of the situation. Gradually, I find the eyes of my teammates drifting towards me.
I clean the sweat from my palms and steady myself with a breath.
I’m sure that I can handle this, but not all on my own.
Obviously! Listen, if he's a protoss, I'm down to grind out endless games. You and me, Mach!
Bolt's play has more depth than proxies and one base all-ins.
Do you have a better idea!? What the hell would he get out of practicing with a terran or a zerg?
Stunt pulls out his phone and dons a stubborn expression. Jett rolls her eyes and glances past him.
Everyone has a role to play in making sure that this team lives on past a botched showmatch. Stunt may—
She winces and then glances begrudgingly in the young protoss’ direction.
—be the only one of us that plays protoss enough to spar with Mach, but this is still a group effort. Accel, you get to test out your coaching chops.
He raises a thumb up without bothering to stand.
You know it.
Reva, work with Mach on openings and strategies. And I’ll see what I can do to get my hands on a few of Bolt’s replays.
Affirmative.
We don’t have any time to waste. Bolt’s going to be preparing for this match with a KPGA regimen.
Think you can handle fourteen hours a day, Mach?
I don’t need to practice long, I just need to practice smart.
You need to do both.
Yeah, she's right. It’s only for a week, anyway.
The idea of fourteen hours of high-level StarCraft is enough to make my wrists sore. Still, I have to live up to my team's expectations.
Alright. Do we start tonight?
Obviously.
...
Ehhhhhhh.......
Jett’s stare is enough to get him to spit it out.
I kinda… maybe… sorta promised my mom that I’d make up all the chores I've been skipping out on at our PC bang.
...
Look! I thought the team was definitely over, okay!? We’re StarCraft players, don’t pretend you guys don’t know the importance of time efficiency!
I need to start smoothing things over with her if I’m going to move out. C’mon, don’t look at me like that...
Useless. Whatever, we’ll meet up at Golden Zonefire tomorrow and every day after that up until the showmatch. Mach, just ladder tonight.
Right.
Reva, you free?
Yes. Why do you ask?
Go with Mach and watch him ladder for the rest of the day. See if you can pick up on any holes in his play.
The command seems to catch Reva off guard. She looks at the ground, at me, and then back at the ground.
Very well.
I've got to go confirm the schedule with Bolt, among other things. With me, Accel.
Should have guessed. Right then.
Stunt, go handle your bullshit. Golden Zonefire tomorrow morning. Go. Everyone. Go.
Accel peels himself off of the bench and falls in line beside Jett. Stunt is quick to follow, though he turns out of the park in different direction.
I share a glance with Reva and scratch behind my head.
I was actually planning on going back to my apartment if I’m just going to ladder…
Oh. Should I return home?
No, no. Uh. Why don’t you meet me there in an hour? You won't need to stay too long, I don’t think.
It’s hard not to seem awkward about the proposal. Even the normally inexpressive Reva has trouble answering casually.
Very well. I will run an errand in the meantime.
After sharing the location of my apartment with a map from my phone, I bid her farewell. Reva fades along with green of Namdan when I trace back the path I took this morning.
My glazed-over eyes remain locked with the pavement as I amble my way home.
I know that I should feel relieved that our team still has a chance of coming together, but I can't help but worry.
I’m not carrying around the weight of my failed attempts to qualify for the VSL anymore. This is different.
It’s anxiety. A tightness in my chest that threatens to strangle me if I let everyone down.
I don’t know what I expected. It’s not like it’s going to get easier from here anyway. Every week in team league there’ll be a chance to cost my team a loss.
More than anything else, I’m frustrated by Mr. Kim's doubt. It's one thing for my friends and parents to misunderstand me, but Mr. Kim made an informed judgement that I'm not worth the trouble.
I jam my fists into my pockets and exhale deeply. If I ever doubted that eSports was brutal, I don’t any longer.
Short as the walk is, I don’t find my nerves calming as I settle into my pace.
A pack of energy drinks might help me douse my angst, so I decide to cut a detour that’ll take me past Go-Mart.
I should probably pick up something for Reva, too. It’d be a pretty classless move to make her watch me grind out ladder games without offering anything in return.
My older brother used to always make me watch him play games back when we were kids.
This is different though. She’s not watching me for fun, she’s watching to tell me how badly I suck.
I brush past another customer on my way into Go-Mart and glance towards the register. Mr. Yeon smiles in my direction, but then immediately walks into the store’s back room.
I don’t waste time browsing and head straight for the refrigerators.
By the time I’m done shopping, Mr. Yeon comes out from the back room with a brown box in hand and makes his way back to the register.
I set my bottles and cans down on the counter and offer the old man a nod.
Hello. This is all for today.
In a rush, are we?
Oh, uh. Not really. Why?
With word that I won't run off, Mr. Yeon smiles wide and hoists the box up onto the counter, pushing aside my drinks in the process.
I blink, dumbfounded. But before I can ask what he’s doing, he clicks open a latch and reveals a wooden board on the underside of the box’s lid.
He flips it up and sets the box between us in the place where a customer might expect to have their groceries rung up.
A cloth sack rests beside the game board, the contents of which clack against one another and the counter. He pulls an object out of the bag and shows it to me.
Have you ever played Go?
Go, huh? It’s a board game that’s played mostly in Asia, held in esteem similar to chess. Without meaning to, I ask the first question on my mind.
Uh. Is this because I told you about my pro-gaming career?
Let’s just say I wouldn’t be showing it to you if you didn’t. We’ll go over the rules and play a round. Just one, and my whim will be satisfied.
Um. Alright.
This is strange. But if I want to keep shopping at Go-Mart, turning down Mr. Yeon will make our future interactions uncomfortable.
Better for one extremely awkward game of Go than an infinite amount of semi-awkward trips to the convenience store.
Mr. Yeon pours the contents of the bag into a pair of wooden cups set beside the board. On closer inspection, they appear worn and scratched up.
The board itself isn’t in great condition either. The corners are chipped and its lacquer is long faded.
Even though I’ve never played, I’m familiar with the premise of Go. Mr. Yeon explains the basic rules thoroughly either way. 
The main objective is to control and capture space by surrounding your opponent’s pieces. It's not unlike StarCraft in that sense. Only, there’s no advantage in quick fingers.
Even if I’m aware of the basics, I don’t have the faintest clue about the game's strategy. What is this supposed to accomplish?
Once Mr. Yeon is finished explaining the rules, he motions towards my stones.
Black takes the first move. You may begin whenever you're ready.
Okay. For the record, I have no idea what I’m doing here.
That’s alright. Just play on instinct.
It’s hard to hide the confusion I’m feeling, but I agree and shuffle a handful of black stones in my direction anyway.
If the point of Go is to control space, it seems like a good idea to form some sort of basic structure that I can play off of later.
But not five turns into the game, Mr. Yeon begins placing his pieces dangerously close to mine. When I look up from the board, he answers me only with a smile.
Soon, he begins capturing my stones with relentless efficiency, never allowing me to challenge his position when I’m so focused on protecting my own.
I fight back to defend my territory, but the clerk's plan is always a step ahead. I fix the board with an intense stare, certain that I can somehow unlock the intricacies of Go by demanding it of myself.
When the board is halfway full, it becomes readily apparent that I’m going to lose.
Mr. Yeon glances up from the board with a raised eyebrow, smile ever-present.
Would you care to stop? I don’t mean to keep you for too long.
No, it's fine. Let’s finish.
After turning down the chance to concede, it feels appropriate that I’d somehow stage an amazing comeback. But the beatdown only continues.
Towards the end of the match, Mr. Yeon manages to capture more than half of my stones in a single move. My displeasure makes itself apparent with a groan.
I deliver my last few turns to the board hard enough to echo a clack throughout the store. Mr. Yeon scratches his chin casually, scanning the carnage he’s wrought upon my pieces.
Hm. I don’t see any possible moves. I pass.
And I pass too. That means the game is over, right?
That is correct.
I release the breath I’ve been holding in, relieved.
I’m so glad to live in an era where video games exist.
The old man replaces his Go set in the bag and box, and clears the counter of our diversion. Yet instead of reaching for my drinks to scan, he sets his eyes on me.
You play to avoid losing.
I feel a frown form on my face. Why exactly am I getting a lesson on an Eastern board game from a cashier?
I don't say anything, so he continues.
Specifically, you play to avoid the pain of a loss. It's clear to see when you have no learned habits or memorized strategies.
There's nothing inherently wrong with playing that way, but you should be aware of the fact. I’m a firm believer that games showcase personality in its purest form.
Was this whole thing just an excuse to share some wisdom you couldn't think of any other way to bring up?
... Tch. I said that with way more disrespect than I should have. Nevertheless, Mr. Yeon’s slight smile doesn’t falter.
Perhaps. Or perhaps I’m just looking for a conversation.
You didn’t quit when I gave you the chance. That’s good. But you can only go so far without playing for the win.
StarCraft isn’t so different from Go. I know that because life isn’t so different from Go. Strive to win, Mach. Not to not lose.
I don’t understand.
Try to. It's an important lesson.
A serious glint flickers across Mr. Yeon's face for a fraction of a second. When it's gone, he looks no different than before.
There’s no one else that moves those drinks off the shelf like you! I’m incentivized to have you succeed and stick around, you see.
He lets out a laugh, one that continues only until I smile politely in response. When he's done, Mr. Yeon rings up my drinks and hurries them into a bag.
Right, off you go. I won’t ask you to play again with me—unless you'd like to.
Um. Alright.
I lower my head in a bow. Not the type reserved for a venerable elder, but at least one to show that I’m thankful.
The door rings when I hurry through it, leaving Mr. Yeon to endure the sickly linoleum of his store alone. 
In a roundabout way, I think Mr. Yeon’s little diversion might actually help.
It’s nice to know that he cares enough about me to offer advice, even if it’s just because I shop at his store.
Whether or not that business about Go and not losing is true remains to be seen. Is an aversion to losing really that ingrained in my DNA?
... Go-Mart. Huh.
Alright Mr. Yeon, I’ll admit that’s pretty clever.
It seems much darker outside than it was when I came into the store. I reach to check the time on—shit!
I have a half dozen missed calls from Reva. Did that Go match seriously take more than an hour?!
An urgent need to get back to my apartment replaces my thoughts of Mr. Yeon and board games. 
I weave through pedestrians as best I can while simultaneously texting an apology to Reva.
My feet carry me as fast as they can. If Reva got tired of waiting in front of my door and left, I’m screwed.
I pant my way up my apartment’s stairs and pause in the hallway to find that she isn’t there. Frustrated, I sigh and force open my door.
I'm dead. I'm so dead. Why didn't I keep track of the time? Why now, why when so much is on the line?
As I rack my brain for an excuse I can offer Jett, I look up to find that my apartment is already occupied.
You are late.
She rises from her seat on my bed and points at the computer.
Ladder.
How… How are you in my room?
The door was not locked. I let myself in when you failed to answer my calls.
You just… came in?
Yes.
My breathing calms as my panic subsides. I forgot to lock my door, huh? I guess this is better than showing up to find my computer missing.
Right. Okay. Sorry, I got caught up with some old guy. Here.
With a rustle, I reach into the bag I’m carrying and hand a drink to Reva.
Caught up?
Reva takes my offering without so much as looking at it. Whether or not she’s actually going to drink it, I’ve done my due diligence as a host.
It’s hard to explain.
You do not need to explain your relationship with an old man if you would rather not.
Even though I’m pretty sure it’s a joke, Reva doesn’t smile to show it. I offer a nervous laugh and fall into my computer chair, trying to move on from the topic of my tardiness.
So, uh. Right. Ladder. Is there something you think I need to practice?
You will want to match against protoss players only. Quit the match if your opponent is terran or a zerg.
Wait... But my ranking!
With a few keystrokes, I display my proudly earned grandmaster badge accompanied by a rank in the double digits.
If I leave two thirds of my games tonight, I’m going to lose a bunch of ladder points.
Are your ladder points really that important?
Absolutely.
Well...
Without a word, Reva takes the mouse from me and logs out of StarCraft 2. Her fingers dance across the keyboard, and a second later we’re logged into her barcode account.
The grandmaster badge accompanying Reva's anonymous username is ranked even higher than mine.
Play on this one then. I do not care about ladder rank, and neither should you.
I scratch behind my head and have the sense to look embarrassed. She’s right. It’s pretty dumb for me to worry about ladder rank at a time like this.
With a nod and a click, I search for my first match of the night. It takes a handful of games before I’m finally matched up against a protoss.
Ugh, he’s got one of those weird names with random capitalization.
Reva sits just over my shoulder from the edge of my bed, eyes fast on the monitor.
Your APM is low.
I wince and respond with a flurry of unneccesary keystrokes. I’ve never cracked 300 APM, even when I’m focused on doing so.
A minute or two passes without comment, though it’s hard to tell whether or not that means she thinks I’m playing well.
Your engineering bays are late.
Are they? They are. Dammit. I whip my mouse hard, box a pair of SCVs, and slam down the two delayed structures.
Delayed upgrades or no, I manage to keep a close enough eye on my opponent’s tech that I have a massive swell of vikings by the time his colossus come into play.
His army gets caught in an awkward position when he tries to establish his third base, allowing me to power forward into his base. It’s a win I’d normally celebrate with a self-assured smile.
But with Reva over my shoulder, I’m forced to feign humility in my victory. I turn towards her and motion towards the screen.
Well? What do you think?
She adjusts her glasses and purses her lips, taking a long moment to decide on her response.
He was bad. But you capitalized on his mistakes, so I have no major complaint.
A good player won’t let you obtain free information. Use your scans wisely.
I thought I used them pretty well, didn’t I? Scouting is one of the things I’m best at.
Not particularly. And you should always aim to be even better.
I grumble and turn to queue up another game. Yet another thing to focus on, I guess.
I had thought that Reva’s low-key attitude might have made her a little bit lenient with my mistakes. But she’s not all that different from Jett, minus how she delivers her criticism.
My next match is on the largest map in the current ladder pool. I’ll have a pretty easy time defending my expansions with the way that the map’s choke points are constructed.
Rather than poke and prod with marines or go for early aggression, I throw down a quick third base in a far-flung corner of the map shortly after I begin my first expansion.
Pulling off this kind of tactic is incredibly rewarding. If it goes unscouted, I'm practically guaranteed to win.
Why are you doing that? Practice something useful.
I shift my gaze aside to find Reva uncomfortably close to both me and the monitor.
What if I decide to hide an expansion against Bolt?
Are you going to risk the team on a coinflip? Cancel it and aim for a long game.
Reva offer the advice too firm to be called a suggestion, and I find myself moving the mouse to do as instructed. This gaffe is going to set me back a fair bit.
I gear up for a drawn out match by focusing on my upgrades and base defense. It’s not long before my protoss opponent and I have split the map in half and are jockeying for position.
Build more defenses. You can afford a dozen planetary fortresses.
Is that really necessary?
Mach, your opponent is protoss. Protoss players will stop at nothing to cheat an honest terran out of an earned win.
Funny. I typically imagine balance whiners as loud and obnoxious in real life. I wonder if she quit playing random out of guilt.
Still, I oblige her and cram as many static defense structures as I can into a vital choke point.
There is an observer over your army.
I squint to find that she’s right. Damn, how did I not catch that earlier? With a scan, I pick off the protoss scout and reposition my units.
It takes a few minutes to adjust my army composition to one that better suits the extreme late game, but I’m soon ready to clash with my opponent.
At this point, StarCraft becomes less about strategy and more about patience. It's important to know when to stalk and when to pounce.
I sense an opening at last and rush into my opponent’s weak flank. Out of the corner of my eye I can see Reva tensing up, invested as much as I am in the outcome of the battle.
But try as I might, my snipes don’t connect with the high templar scattered amongst the protoss army.
He drowns my units in psi storm and steamrolls down the center of the map, destroying my constructed defenses along the way.
I struggle pointlessly to mount a counteroffensive, but the damage is done. I’m forced to tap out a gg and quit the match with a huff.
He controlled his army better than you did.
I spin in my chair to face Reva with a frown.
If he didn’t, I would have won. Ugh, that was so close!
Yes, it was.
At least she can concede a point to my credit when it’s deserved. But damn, that match took a while. As long as Go with Mr. Yeon, if not longer.
What time do you need to leave?
Are you throwing me out?
What? No. I’m just saying if you need to be home at a certain time, let me know.
I do not.
Okay.
Sheesh. Why does talking to her feel so unnatural? This has to be intentional on her part.
I need a break.
Your opponents will use every wasted moment to become better than you. Breaks are dangerous.
Just a short one! I’m thirsty, anyway. We’ll be back on the ladder with a vengeance afterwards.
Hm... 
Thirsty... 
I see.
My fist clenches involuntarily as I reach for a can, nearly forcing me to knock it over. I offer Reva an exhausted look before cracking open my drink.
Not to be outdone, I take a poised sip before glancing casually in her direction.
So, why do you pretend to be a guy on the internet?
Now it’s Reva’s turn to tense up. Her face contorts, eyes glazing over as if scanning her internal database for a scathing comeback.
404, comeback not found.
I do no such thing! Details about my private life are kept just so: private. Others simply assume.
Well, that’s all coming to an end if we’re going to be on Team Enoch, isn’t it?
I suppose.
Excited about living in a team house?
As long as it is being paid for, yes.
Oh, in it for that eSports money, eh?
Of course. Since primary school I have dreamed of my own bunk bed and free cup noodles.
Reva is refreshingly realistic about pro-gamer living conditions. Maybe she can talk some sense into Stunt.
To be frank, anything is better than life back at home.
Oh? Trouble with your parents?
No. My parents worked hard to give me the opportunities they never had, and for that I will always be grateful. But they live far from Seoul, so I was isolated from my friends for most of my life.
You mean your online friends?
Yes. But now, I have the chance to make my own way. I take pride in the fact that I have turned my skills into a living, no matter how meager.
You should be. Most people living off of StarCraft do it with the support of a team, but you've managed on your own. You have the right to be proud.
Maybe. But sometimes, even though I am happy with my accomplishments, I lack the confidence to devote more of myself to this game.
Really? I wouldn’t have expected to hear something like that from you.
Why?
I don’t know. You kinda seem like the resolute type. No regrets. That sort of thing.
I’m bad at putting into words my impression of Reva, but she seems to understand what I mean by the nod she offers.
You are correct that I always give full effort to my pursuits.
However, this is not a matter of regret. Normally, I can be satisfied even in failure if I have done my best.
But what if the task was not worth working towards in the first place?
What do you mean? eSports is like anything else, isn’t it? It’s a climb to the top.
It is. But StarCraft is inherently less valuable than most other things. Art, athletics, education, science, a corporate career. Objectively, my time is better spent on almost anything other than pro-gaming.
But I do not believe I can truly distinguish myself at any of those things, while it is possible as a pro-gamer.
I was born in the right country, I am the correct age, and I have enough required talent.
Even then, it is not logical for me to spend so much time and effort on what should statistically prove unrewarding. Yet I cannot bring myself to turn down the chance to compete.
I have the same drive, so I can at least understand that. But you really won't do something if you can’t be the best at it? And the way you talk about your motivation...
Do you even like StarCraft?
No. I don't.
She answers bluntly and then looks away. I have nothing to say to that.
High level StarCraft isn't always fun in the traditional sense of the word, but it sounds like Reva genuinely doesn't enjoy the game.
For her to be as good as she is with that holding her back is hard to understand.
StarCraft's greatest players have always credited their love of the game as a major factor in their success. How far can she hope to go without that advantage?
With silence filling the space between us, Reva takes the opportunity to try out the drink I brought for her. On the first taste, she screws her face up and hurries to set it down.
How can you stand something so sugary?
I shrug, since I don’t have a good answer. It’s not like I can explain why something tastes good.
Where are you living if not with your parents?
Do you know what a goshiwon is?
... No way. Really?
That’s a term that showed up in one of my online lessons. If I remember correctly, it’s an absurdly tiny type of apartment. Literally the size of a closet, with a low price to match.
I live on the edge of Seoul, so rent is inexpensive. I pay with my winnings from online tournaments.
Matches on the last week of every month if I have not yet hit my quota can be very stressful. That has been my life since I graduated from high school.
Damn. You don’t mind the lack of space?
I do. I am enjoying the chance to stretch while it lasts.
She demonstrates by falling back onto my bed and fully extending her legs. I shake my head and try not to laugh.
It’ll last. The team house will be a nice upgrade for the both of us.
Reva sits up and rests her arms on her knees.
Break time is over. Return to the ladder.
Alright, alright.
I spin my chair back towards my computer and resume my training.
The blue light from my computer monitor shines in Reva’s glasses, her advice and my grumbling all that is said between us.
The matches bleed into each other, one foe falling after another. I’m in a protoss-slaying groove.
I don’t often find myself on winning streaks on ladder. Part of me wonders if I’m playing this well only to impress her.
Reva goes quiet in the middle of a particularly intense game, leaving only the sounds of my keyboard and mouse clicks to mingle with the game sounds blasting from my headphones.
I manage to prolong my win streak with a multi-pronged attack that forces my opponent to tap out. With a triumphant grin, I push off the desk and turn.
Boom! Three in a…
... And find that Reva has fallen asleep on duty.
Well. That explains why she didn’t point out that my dropships were delayed. Is it really that late?
I rest my hand against my cheek. Should I wake her up and tell her to go home?
Ugh. She looks too peaceful for me to do that in good conscience. I can just sleep on the floor, I guess.
I bunch up a hoodie from my dresser into a makeshift pillow and ease myself into the space under my desk. The ground isn’t exactly comfortable, but with enough shifting around I find a decent spot.
Not long after, my eyelids grow heavy and sleep claims me.
I'm on the floor. Why am I on the floor?
The trash on my desk is gone and my bed is made. I literally never make my bed.
... Right. Reva.
When I stand, an ache in my back forces me to wince. It’s nothing serious, but I must have turned over in my sleep onto a weird angle.
A text message from Reva awaits me when I check my phone for the time.
I apologize for falling asleep. I will see you later.
Terse, as I’ve come to expect from her. I lock my phone's screen and slip it into my pocket.
The week ahead is going to be tough. Six days probably isn’t enough time to make any sort of serious breakthrough in terms of my mechanics or game sense.
But it’s long enough to craft a game plan that might edge out Bolt. My biggest issue with the matchup is that I have no idea what to expect from him.
How does a Brood War player go about learning StarCraft 2? Maybe I should ask Jett or Accel.
Whatever the case, the team is probably waiting for me at Golden Zonefire. I should hurry over.
Morning, Mach.
Morning.
An oblivious Stunt fails to notice my arrival. He's too focused on his white whale.
Where’s Jett?
Trying to wrangle some of Bolt’s replays I’d guess. We couldn't find him at the Shock team house yesterday, so I spent the rest of the evening moving out of the Crash house.
That sounds awkward.
You're not wrong.
Well, Reva’s probably gonna be late today. She probably needs to go back home after—
I try and fail to stop myself in time. The allure of PopPop Safari now fails to hold Stunt's attention.
She slept at your place? Did you bang her?!
No! It wasn’t like that at all. We just practiced.
Ooh, genius move Mach! She seems pretty inexperienced, smart to let her practice a bit before she—
Ow! Okay, okay! Sheesh!
I follow up the shoulder punch with a pat and then take note of Accel's serious expression.
Mach. You didn’t actually do anything, right?
No, I didn’t.
Good. Don't get involved with your teammates.
Eh? Why?
Seriously? I'm sure you can figure this one out on your own.
If you break up, things get awkward?
If you get together, things get awkward. If you break up, the team loses a player. It’s bad news, even in the best case scenario.
She came over to watch me ladder. It got late, and she fell asleep during a long game. That’s all.
Then there’s no problem.
Being a coach means I get to deal with fun stuff like telling you who you can and can’t date.
Stunt’s hand slinks for his phone, but Accel snaps for attention before the protoss can get back to tapping away at animal bubbles.
Enough, Stunt. Time for practice. Mach, you too.
Right.
By noon, my wrists are sore from a morning of anti-rush defense. Without anything specific to practice against, Stunt spammed me with game after game of proxy gates, cannon rushes, and one base all-ins.
I feel prepared in the incredibly unlikely case that Bolt risks the match on something like a two gate. Stunt’s a one-note protoss, but he plays that note pretty damn well.
Can you try something else for a change? My brain is starting to fry.
Heh, I’m not even warmed up yet. You're only able to defend against these builds because you're expecting them.
Obviously! The point of a cheese is to catch the opponent off guard! What's the point of cheesing when it's literally all you can do?!
Ugh, you don’t understand. Cheesing is an art. An art that I will be the first to master.
Seriously though, Mach needs to prepare for more than just your one-base all-ins. Try playing standard for a change.
Ehh. Fine.
Just then, Jett steps through the doors of Golden Zonefire at a fierce pace, saving me from more of Stunt’s abusive builds.
But the relief I feel at her arrival shatters when I catch sight of the figure at her heels.
Before I can form a question at Bolt’s presence, both he and Jett are standing before us. She shoots an annoyed glance at him before speaking.
He insisted on speaking with you before he would agree to play.
Bolt lifts his chin at me, savoring the moment. I need something from him—a showmatch—and he’s well aware of the power it grants him.
So, Mach. Still desperate to make a name for yourself?
I match his aloof expression with a hard one, determined to show that he can't intimidate me.
Our sponsor needs a demonstration of the team’s potential. It’s not about me.
Don’t kid yourself, this is all about you. I’d be facing Jett, Accel, or one of the wannabe dishwashers you managed to clown into signing if it wasn't. Do you think I haven't read what they're saying online?
I draw in a sharp breath, to Bolt’s amusement. He shakes out his wrist and offers a shrug.
I normally have better things to do than play out a showmatch in a lesser game. But hey, you’ve caught me at a good time.
My next Brood War match isn’t for a few weeks. Got just enough time to brush up on my SC2 and ship you back across the Pacific.
Did you know that my team manager won’t even let me play Star2 in the Shock team house? They say it’s distracting to the other players.
I reach for another calming breath, but find myself choking on rage instead. It’s that smile of his.
What, you came here just to talk some trash? Quit wasting my time and accept the match.
I accept. And I’ll do you one better than you’ll do me. Catch.
Bolt pulls something out of his pocket and tosses it at me. My reflexes don’t fail me and I snag the small, black object in midair.
When I open my hand, I find a thumb drive.
What…?
Fifty replays. Study them all you like. You'll have no excuse when you lose.
By the way Jett, let me give you a tip. Next time you go behind my back for replays, don't try to get them from someone that shares my feelings on your opportunist bullshit.
Your foreigner mascot is lucky that I'm feeling generous.
With an infuriating air of superiority, Bolt turns to leave. My teammates visibly share my frustration, but none of them rush to my defense.
Maybe it’s for good reason. I can't keep relying on Jett or Accel to bail me out of trouble.
Beating Bolt isn't their responsibility. It's mine.
Hey, Bolt.
He turns, mild surprise showing on his face when I flick the thumb drive out of my hand and at his feet.
I won't lose to you again. Remember it.
Tell yourself that.
He shows his teeth in a smirk and crushes the flash drive under his heel.
Just like you told yourself you could qualify for VSL.
Bits of plastic and metal are all that remains of the USB when he lifts his foot to continue on his way out.
The tension remains long after Bolt's departure. Finally, Jett enters my personal space, eyes sharp and locked with mine.
Why did you do that?! We needed his replays!
Accel steps forward and places a hand on Jett’s shoulder.
Bolt was trying to get into Mach’s head. You know that, Jett. It was the right call.
Dang. He really didn’t feel like leaning over to pick it up, huh? Those things are like ten thousand won.
The quip earns him a perplexed stare from Accel and Jett. I'm too distracted to even react.
Whatever. Mach, if you’re going to be a showman, save it for when it’ll gain you some fans.
That gives me an idea for a ceremony after you beat this guy! Get like ten flash drives and—
Hey Stunt, I’ve got a better idea for a ceremony. We sign a contract with Enoch and move into our team house. How’s that sound?
That’s not as funny as what I had in mind.
Enough banter. Get back to practicing.
... Can we take a break or something? I need a minute.
We don't have a minute, especially without replays. Practice. Now.
I quietly follow Stunt's lead back towards the PCs. Accel and Jett move in and take their seats behind us.
From the top. And no rushes, Stunt.
I have absolutely no clue how anyone can practice for more than ten hours a day.
My wrists ache. My eyes hurt. My subconscious won’t consider anything but unit compositions and attack timings. And I can't get Bolt's stupid smirk out of my head.
Worse still, with Jett forcing Stunt to play standard, our practice wasn't productive at all.
She didn't seem happy with me when she left to meet with the producers at the VSL studio. But after so many games, it becomes impossible for me to focus.
What else are we supposed to do? Reva doesn’t seem like she’s in practice for any race but terran.
Do I even have a chance against Bolt? Did I ever in the first place?
Dude. How does anyone macro!? It’s boring, exhausting, and makes you consider zillion variables. Economy management is so stupid.
You just described what StarCraft is supposed to be, minus the boring part.
Well I don’t like it. I’m at my best when I can focus microing. Who says I should have to play a game past the ten minute mark?
No one, as long as you're okay with an awful winrate.
With practice done for the day, I agreed to join Accel and Stunt for dinner while Jett deals with logistics and setup for the match.
I’m led down a smoky side street where greasy and fragrant smells mingle. My experience with street food so far hasn’t been great, but I trust the judgement of Stunt and Accel.
Row after row of stalls are thick with customers clamoring for a hot meal. The three of us browse the various offerings before Stunt insists on one in particular.
Do you like bindaetteok, Mach?
Sure, yeah. Whatever's fine.
The single cook manning the stall cleaves through customer orders faster than I think possible. It isn’t long before we’re walking away from the stall, paper wrapped pancake in hand.
We settle for a seat on the curb, far enough away from the foot traffic to avoid being trampled.
Reva’s going to run into trouble with Jett if she doesn’t show at Golden Zonefire again this week.
Eh. She can only help Mach so much. Besides, it’s not like she can skip out on practice at the team house.
Have you ever even been inside a team house, Stunt?
The protoss forces down his food with a thump to the chest.
No. But I’ve seen pictures.
It’s an informal setting. It isn't hard to sleep in or slack off, but the type of people that do that usually don’t become pro-gamers. Or, at the least don’t last long as one.
We still don’t have any subs. Isn't that going to be a problem?
Let’s worry about one thing at a time. There won’t be much need for subs if we don’t do our best this week.
Still, the team is tiny. Five people, including management? Jett wasn’t kidding when she said she wanted a lean team.
The sudden thought of a team goshiwon is almost enough to make me smile.
Yo, Accel. What did you do with all of your prize money from Brood War?
That’s kind of a personal question, isn’t it?
I don’t mind answering. Spent about half of it on general living expenses and stuff for my family. The rest I’ve got saved.
Lame. What’s the point of winnings if you don’t spend them?
I've earned forty million won or so, not counting salary. That may sound like a lot, but it’s easy to go through if you aren’t responsible.
Deaf to the sense Accel is trying to talk into him, Stunt stares off into space with stars in his eyes.
If I won the VSL Grand Final, I’d buy a car, a house, a new PC........
He continues, rattling off a list of a dozen superfluous objects in a way that only someone who has lived without worrying about paying rent can.
Accel and I both take the chance to eat without interruption.
Jett’s still got the hundred million won from the first VSL Championship, yeah?
That plus some, probably. Why?
I wonder if I could convince her to trick out the team house...
Feel free to ask. Just make sure I'm there for her reaction.
What about you, Mach? What would you do with your big winnings?
I don't know. Save it or something.
And I thought that only the chicks on our team were boring.
Don’t forget that all the time you spend climbing StarCraft's ladder, someone else spends climbing the corporate ladder. If you're only in eSports for the money, just get a real job.
Psh, it’s no big deal. After I make it big as the next protoss bonjwa, I’ll just get a job as a coach or a team owner. I’ve got it all planned out.
There’s no convincing Stunt at this rate, not that I can blame him. I wasn’t any more responsible when I was his age.
With a final bite, what’s left of my bindaetteok is little more than grease on a napkin. I’m joined by my teammates when I move to toss away the trash.
Heading home, Mach?
Yeah. Gonna ladder for a bit and then sleep.
Gotcha. I’ll be at the cafe by ten. Don’t be late.
Not like we have anything better to do.
The three of us turn separate ways out of the alley. I endure the walk back to my apartment in silence.
I stare at my cellphone, the light coming from its screen bright enough to make my eyes glaze.
Then, it goes dark, and I slide my thumb over its screen to wake it.
I’ve repeated this ritual four times now.
My head falls back against my chair, and I close my eyes. Why do I feel like this?
It’s been almost two weeks since I last spoke with my parents. Admittedly, I’ve been busy with StarCraft since I met Accel and Jett, but I’m still overdue for a call.
My finger hovers over the contact number. Before it can fall to dial them, the phone escapes my hand and falls back onto the desk.
Does it really matter? I don’t have much to say. 
‘Hi Mom, is Dad there? Yes everything is fine. No, I’m not dead. No, I haven’t given up yet.’
Telling them about the team might be for nothing. They'll pretend to share my happiness in a victory, but there’s always an underlying cynicism to every congratulation from them.
A win isn’t a win. It’s another crumb leading me to chase a pointless eSports dream and away from the life they think I should be living.
It feels wrong to be cross with them. They raised me, paid for my existence. I’d be an ingrate to ask for more.
And yet, I do. I want them to accept my goals for what they are. To hope for more than that I’ll grow out of StarCraft.
It’s the same with my friends from high school. They pretend not to, but I know that they look down on me.
'It’s a video game. Why do you care so much? C'mon man, it's time you grew out of this.'
When is it right to give up on a dream? How many failures does it take before you say: Alright, I’m done trying. I’ll just take a job at the family business.
If I lose to Bolt, should I quit StarCraft? Would it be nothing but pride to continue on?
Even if I win, what then? What if the team does poorly? What if the team does well, but I hold them back?
Will StarCraft 2 even last as long as Brood War? What if there isn’t any prize money left in the scene in a year from now? What if I start to hate the game?
It's wrong to think this way before such a high stakes match, but I can’t help it. I know what matters, and I know what I have to do. Why can't I just do it?
I carry myself onto the bed and bury my face in my pillow.
Somehow, I think I’m finally starting to understand what Mr. Yeon was saying.
I’m awake.
I’ve been awake, actually, but I don’t feel like getting up.
I tell myself to for the third time, but I don’t.
'We have to practice.'
But I don’t feel like practicing.
'Dude. Get up. The team is waiting for you.'
I just want to lie here though. Can’t I just do that?
'No.'
I’m probably sick from the street food. I’m just going to lie here until I feel better.
'You aren’t sick. Get up.'
Not now. Soon, though.
'Don’t you want to beat Bolt? That guy is a total prick. If you don’t practice, he’ll beat you and you’ll feel terrible.'
I already feel terrible though. I'm just going to lay here.
'Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up.
The sound of repeated, unrelenting knocks wakes me. A glance at my phone answers my immediate question. It’s 2:00 PM.
I shamble my way to my door and glance through the peephole into the hallway.
It’s Jett. She doesn’t look happy.
I turn the knob and crack the door open, offering no resistance when she forces it the rest of the way open.
She glances over me, not bothering to veil the disgust in her expression.
What are you doing? The entire team has been waiting for you to show up.
Her tone demands an answer, and I rush to oblige it with an excuse.
I don’t feel well.
You look fine. Get dressed and get your ass to Golden Zonefire.
I run a hand through my matted hair and glance away.
I’m serious, I feel awful. I don’t think practicing today 
makes much since considering I might burn myself out. It's important that I
Jett's palm cracks against the left side of my face. I call out in a mixture of pain and shock and try to step back.
Instead, Jett catches me by my shirt and pulls me forward, visibly restraining herself from bringing the back of her hand across my other cheek.
I gasp for breath and bring a hand to where she struck me. Her eyes, hard and determined, refuse to leave mine.
What... why... did you do that...
Why are you here, Mach? Why did you come to Korea?
What…? To… to play StarCraft. You already know the answer...
No, you didn’t. You have some natural talent for StarCraft, but you didn’t come here to make use of it.
What on Earth is she talking about? I feel my voice harden in my throat when I argue back.
You just hit me for nothing! I came to Korea because I want to play in the VSL! Because I want to be a champion.
And yet you can’t drag your sorry ass out of bed to prep for the showmatch that an entire team is counting on you to win.
Stop lying to yourself. Or at the very least, stop lying to me. I put a lot of trust in you, Mach. I honestly hoped that you’d prove you have what it takes to make something of yourself.
But you clearly don’t. You quit when it gets hard, and your minor accomplishments help fuel the lie that you're capable something great without putting in the work.
The ferocity in Jett’s eyes dies out as she relinquishes her vice on my undershirt. I stumble back, clutching at the wall to keep from falling over.
You have less than a week to pretend that you care about what happens to yourself and to this team.
If you can't do that for your own sake, then do it for ours.
After ten long, sobering seconds of unanswered silence, she turns, stalks into the hallway, and slams the door.
The wall is rough against my side as I slide down it and onto the floor.
It's not long before I'm tired of replaying my stale reasoning.
My apartment's view of the Seoul skyline offers a moment's relief. It makes the decision a little bit easier.
One way or another, I'm not coming home.
The looks of disdain, the fake reassurances. It's all that's left for me once I step on that plane and admit that I'm a failure.
If I can't swing a single match victory with four other people carrying me, what can I possibly hope to accomplish with the rest of my life?
I let out a long breath. I'm tired. And even though I wouldn't mind falling asleep against this wall, I find myself rising to my feet.
Is it narcissism or masochism? It would be so much easier for me to just accept that I was never cut out for this in the first place.
I really just can't quit, huh?
This is such a joke.
Go Mart’s chime sings out as I push my way into the store. Snow white hair and a wrinkly forehead perk up from behind the counter as I stand in the doorway of his store.
Mr. Yeon.
Hmm? Come for another round of Go, Mach? Or just here to take your drinks and scram?
It isn’t until he gets a good look at me that the smile drops off his face.
Something the matter?
Did you play Go professionally?
He nods once, so I continue.
Why did you play? What kept you going? How did you stop yourself from quitting?
A little philosophical, don’t you think? Take a breath, Mach. What's going on?
At first, I try to explain as vaguely as I can. But as Mr. Yeon nods along, allowing me to ramble uninterrupted, I find myself divulging more and more details. 
I stop only when it comes time to explain my encounter with Jett this afternoon and the evening I spent sitting in my apartment.
You're right. I go to whatever lengths I can to avoid pain, and I’ve done it all my life.
StarCraft is the only thing I’ve ever been decent at, and I can’t commit to it because I'm afraid I'll fail.
But it's not just that. I can't quit either. My biggest fear of all is admitting to myself that I'm not good enough. I want to believe that as long as I try, I'm not worthless.
I ran away to South Korea with the stupid idea that I could make something of myself. Like the world owed me something just for showing up.
I'm just tired. I don't want to run anymore.
Despite my ragged voice and slumped shoulders, Mr. Yeon finds himself a nonchalant smile.
Then don’t. It’s much easier to walk.
A slight chuckle escapes him. When it ends, he gestures past me to his store.
Mach. I’m closing in on seventy and work at a convenience store at two in the morning. Some would call that failure. But I don’t regret the days I spent studying and competing in Go.
If we live without pursuing our passions, what good is living at all?
Prizes, fame, status… These things are achieved by few. But every competitor must play for a love of the game and the pride of a well-earned victory.
Competition is a noble thing. It drives us to improve, innovate, and test the limits of who we are and what we can do. It took humans into space.
You wouldn’t seek a reason to keep at it if you didn’t already know there's value in that.
I lean onto the counter separating us, the tension in my chest softening.
I do. And you’re right. But I can’t stop worrying that it won’t be worth it in the end. Or that even if I try my best, I’ll fail.
You might not achieve everything you set out to, even if you work as hard as you can. No success worth chasing is ever guaranteed.
But do you want to spend the rest of your life wondering what you were capable of? My own answer to that was no.
I glance away and rake my hand through my hair. There’s no way that I’ve come this far only to give up now.
When I straighten up, he beams a pleased smile at me.
Now then. If I were you, I would head home and get some rest. You’ve got a match to prepare for, after all.
I find myself at an utter loss for words. Gratitude forms and falls apart between my lips a handful of times before I simply settle for a deep bow.
Thank you, Mr. Yeon.
You're welcome, Mach.
By the way, the next time you come by for an old man’s wisdom, you'll have to buy something first.
For the first time today, I catch myself smiling.
Heh. Okay, deal.
Just then, a customer pushes open the door to the store. Though there wasn’t much else I had to say, now is probably an appropriate time to depart.
As I turn to leave, Mr. Yeon lifts his fist at me.
Work hard.
I raise mine to match his.
I will.
Apprehension hangs over me as I stand before the doors to Golden Zonefire. Waiting won’t make this any easier.
With a stride belying my frantic heart rate, I make my way to a table seating the four teammates I neglected the day before.
But whatever reason I have to worry disappears when Accel catches sight of me. He rises from his chair and waves me over, leading Reva and Stunt to follow suit.
It’s only Jett that refuses eye contact with me. Even then, though she’s trying to hide it, I can tell that she’s relieved I’m here.
Hey, Mach. Ready for practice?
Yeah. And sorry about yesterday. It won’t happen again.
No sweat. Let’s make the most of the time we have left, yeah?
Yeah.
Alright. Stunt, Mach. Go setup your PCs and get to work.
Stunt jumps up from the table and steers himself to my side as we make our way to the setups.
Me and Reva played 2v2s while Jett was gone yesterday. I'm pretty sure we could be ranked number one on the ladder with enough time.
No one takes 2v2s seriously, much less on ladder.
Pft, says you. But hey, good that you're already feeling better. If you puke, I'll know it's because my strategy is what's sick.
I lift an eyebrow, trying to unravel Stunt's meaning. It's only with a glance back at Jett and then Accel that it clicks.
Yeah. I'm all better.
He snerks and peels away from my side to pick out a PC. Jett, Accel and Reva follow at a distance, the latter two setting up chairs behind me to observe and make comments.
Even with my renewed focus and drive, it becomes readily apparent after a few matches that our practice is still going to be suboptimal.
Stunt’s trying his best, but it doesn’t mean much with less than a week until the showmatch.
He simply doesn't execute standard builds very well. Accel says as much after I trip my way through another clumsy win.
We might need to look into finding someone else for Mach to practice with. But there really isn’t enough time...
It may be more productive for him to face opponents on ladder.
It won’t be possible for Mach to prepare against certain builds that way, but at this rate you might be right.
Stunt, no one’s going to deny your unit control, but you just don't have the strategic breadth of someone like Bolt.
The young protoss player slumps in his chair and stares off into space.
I know. Sorry.
Did I really come this far just to face Bolt unprepared? There has to be a solution.
Reva, do you think you could play in place of Stunt?
I have not played protoss in more than a month. Without a week's worth of practice, I would be a lesser opponent than Stunt.
Damn. Truth be told, even her terran micro isn’t all that great. I’d hate to see her try to control something like blink stalkers without the time to get back in shape.
Still, it seems wasteful that we haven’t been putting her game knowledge to good use.
Could we look around the cafe for a protoss, maybe?
Jett is first to answer, and does so without acknowledging me.
Look around. Half the people in here are playing this new MOBA bullshit. Decent StarCraft players only show up for All-Out Attack.
Unless they need a practice space for a showmatch, apparently.
He laughs to lighten the mood, but Jett is right. Looking for someone outside of the cafe will probably take too long as well.
None of Jett or Accel’s old teammates will want to help either, especially with the PR surrounding the team.
C'mon... Think. Be resourceful.
If Stunt isn’t providing enough strategies for me to prepare for, and Reva can’t put the strategies that she knows into action…
Wait a second! What Stunt said earlier...
What if we practiced 1v2?
Eh. What?
Stunt handles the units, and Reva handles the base management and picks the build order. That way, I can face the best of them both.
Will that even work?
Accel glances to Reva, who seems as surprised by my plan as he is.
I don’t see why it wouldn’t. It won’t be a perfectly realistic game condition, but it’s better than anything else I can think of.
That sounds kinda fun, actually. C’mon, Reva.
Stunt pats the seat of the station next to him. With a shrug, she rises to join him.
Very well.
Jett replaces herself in Reva’s vacated seat, arms crossed and expression fierce. She’s intent on seeing for herself whether or not this will work.
When Stunt is done joking about doing a fusion dance with Reva, we load up a game with Reva and Stunt on the same team and a setting enabled to keep Reva’s base from spawning.
So I don’t have to worry about anything except destroying Mach? This is going to be great. Hey, Reva, build two gateways by his base for me.
No. We are playing standard.
Come on... Okay, how about a proxy stargate then?
No.
I can hear you, you know.
It will not matter. Such is the beauty of standard play.
I soon find that her confidence is well placed. Even with Reva's economy-focused build order, Stunt's stalker harass soon makes my life difficult.
He dances the single unit back and forth at the entrance to my natural, all of his focus devoted to its control.
It's a painfully effective frustration that succeeds in slowing down my attempts at establishing economy and tech.
My multitasking and micro are brought to their limits, and we haven’t even hit the five minute mark. This is insane.
And very, very good practice.
I don’t have the chance to spare a glance over my shoulder at Accel or Jett, but I’d make a pretty sure bet that they’re just as intent on the game as Stunt, Reva, and I are.
The match drags on until the Stunt and Reva archon rolls over my paltry force with a well-timed and perfectly controlled two-base push. It wasn't even close.
Well. They make for a tough opponent, that’s for sure. You three down to keep at this?
Are you kidding?! This is amazing!
I am enjoying myself as well.
The point isn’t to have fun, it’s to practice.
Run a nexus first. I want to see how Mach handles it.
It’s incredible. Playing an opponent at this level allows me to see the game in an all new way.
Stunt’s control is precise and crashes against my defense like a wave, while Reva directs the flow of battle like a symphony's conductor.
They have achieved purity of form. Through these repeated losses, I can see just how outmatched I am in nearly every aspect of StarCraft.
The moments of weakness for an opponent that plays such a clean style are scant and short-lived, but they exist. I can create them by taking risks, using mind games, or forcing mistakes.
I've felt these things on instinct before, but I can now see them for the truths they are.
The element of human error is practically zero between Stunt and Reva.
But StarCraft is a game of imperfect information. Anyone, even a perfect machine, is capable of being defeated.
I'm done being afraid of you, Bolt.
It’s late in the evening when Accel calls our practice quits. Twelve hours straight, minus breaks for lunch and dinner.
Four more days of that, and he’ll be as ready as he possibly can be in that amount of time.
We risk Stunt and Reva falling out of practice, but there really isn’t any other choice. At least it won’t be for long.
Jett still hasn’t acknowledged me with direct eye contact, but the animosity I felt coming from her this morning is all but gone.
Neither Stunt or Reva seem even a fraction as out of it as I am. Yet as tired as I am, I find myself eager for practice tomorrow.
I can only hope it lasts until the end of the week.
I’ve got a few more things to take care of before the weekend. The VSL studio managed to fit us in a time slot right before the semi finals for team league.
I’ve seen some of the promotion they’re doing online. It’s being hyped as a KPGA vs. foreigner match.
Mach's been cast as the villain. A last minute way of hyping up the match since it was on such short notice.
The Korean Pro-Gamer Association would not have allowed one of their players to compete otherwise.
It seems they are beginning to sow the seeds for the transition from Brood War to StarCraft 2.
It’s hard to imagine that the talent pool for StarCraft 2 could get any more deep. Bolt is only one of a few dozen top-tier players being held back by the floodgates of KPGA’s regulations.
A win against Bolt ought to show KPGA players and their fanboys not to shrug off those of us who switched to StarCraft 2 early.
No need for so much bite, Jett. We switched because we were ready for a new challenge, right?
She glances away, failing to match Accel’s now wavering grin.
I need to go. The rest of you, get some rest.
Yo, Reva. Wanna grab some dinner? We can practice our fusion dance for tomorrow.
A potara earring is necessary for fusion between two distinct beings, Stunt. And the hyperbolic time chamber is a more apt metaphor for Mach’s training regimen regardless.
A bickering Stunt and Reva exit shortly behind the stone-eyed Jett, leaving only me and Accel to the half-empty cafe.
Don’t bother worrying about yesterday.
Jett told you, huh?
Even if she didn’t, it’d be an easy guess. You weren’t giving it your all when we called it quits the day before.
Figures.
A sigh escapes me, leading Accel to drop a hand on my shoulder.
Just focus on the showmatch. If you still want to worry about sleeping in after winning, you can mope around the team house for a day.
Despite my best efforts, I can’t keep myself from spitting out a laugh.
Things have changed so much since I met you and Jett.
For the better, I hope?
Yeah. You guys are so goal driven. It's kind of mindblowing, actually.
Best way to live, if you ask me. And good practice for the real challenge.
Don’t think Jett will be satisfied with a little bit of money from Enoch. You won't have time to pick the confetti out of your hair before hearing all about next season's plan.
If she ever finds a reason to talk to me again, that is.
Jett has her way of dealing with things. Don't sweat it too much and just focus on your practice.
Right, I will.
I rise from my chair at last, checking my pockets on the way up for my key and wallet.
Take care. I'm going to stick around and ladder for a while. Coach has to keep his skills current, you know.
Will you join the team as a player when your contract with Crash is up at the end of the year?
Who knows? Let’s just worry about the next few days, yeah?
Fair enough. Later, Accel.
He falls right back into his chair after a fist bump, leaving me to stalk the neon lit streets alone.
The city lights have never been so beautiful. I have no desire to leave Seoul’s electric embrace now that things are finally starting to make sense.
What if I hadn’t run into Accel at Golden Zonefire? I’d probably be booking my ticket for a flight home at the end of the month right about now.
And without Jett, there would be no team. No goal, past the vague dream to qualify for the VSL.
If not for Stunt or Reva, I’d have no sparring partners. No teammates. Not to mention, no way to have earned Jett's confidence in front of Mr. Kim.
... Mr. Kim. No matter how he rubs me the wrong way, he's as much a part of my chance to stay here as my teammates.
And Mr. Yeon. Who’d have thought that the convenience store clerk I’d been avoiding eye contact with would be the one to bring me back from the brink?
By whatever means necessary, I’ll repay those that have helped me stand where I do now.
For the third time, if you scout the second gas, build a damn bunker! Don’t be so greedy!
Make sure you stay clear of his vision if you’re going to take that kind of drop path.
They’ll try to roll over you with colossus if they manage to pick off your dropships. Prioritize your viking production first!
... Yes! Just like that.
With a couple of snipes on the Stunt + Reva combination’s high templar, the protoss army is left bereft any kind of area of effect damage, allowing me to charge forward and go for the jugular.
Even with Stunt’s top tier control and Reva’s highly efficient production, I manage to push my way into their base and secure not one, but two ggs.
I leap out of my seat in triumphant victory. Out of almost a hundred games, that’s the third win I’ve managed to clinch.
It feels amazing. I wasn't sure that I'd be able to manage a breakthrough as a result of this kind of practice, but my control has noticeably improved.
A good thing, considering the match with Bolt is tomorrow.
Gaaaah! She insisted on building more high templar when I asked for colossus!
It was strategically unsound to push onto the map. You should have allowed our upgrades to complete and used the high templar as drop defense.
What do you know?! You don’t even play protoss!
Reva places her index finger on Stunt’s forehead, easily keeping him at arm’s length.
The pair quiets their harmless squabbling when Jett rises.
That’s enough for today.
Eh? But it’s barely six o’clock.
The day before an important match is the most important. Not in terms of practice, but to prepare mentally.
Jett says so to no one in particular, making it a point to ignore me when I turn to look at her.
A new age method, huh? Better than the all-night cram sessions from the Brood War days, I suppose.
It’s scientifically proven to work. Besides, it’s not like I’m giving him the rest of the day to do as he pleases.
Damn. With Jett, even relaxation is ordained.
C'mon. We’re going to Namdan.
Again with Namdan? Pro-gamers don’t belong in a place without computers.
Would you rather spend the rest of the day cleaning ashtrays at your mom's?
You know what! You’re all just jealous that you don’t have a PC bang in the family!
The rest of us share a laugh on the way out with Stunt trailing after us begrudgingly.
Given the mood coming out of the cafe, I’m surprised to find that none of us have all that much to say as we loiter around a park bench.
Stunt’s attention never strays from the game on his phone, while Reva and Accel simply stare off into space.
Jett paces back and forth, though her gait lacks its usual purpose. Between all five of us, silence.
Maybe not all that much needs to be said. We all know the stakes. Everyone’s done their part to prepare for tomorrow.
It’s natural for us to feel nervous. The key is to keep it from affecting our chance of winning.
It is sad.
I shift my gaze towards Reva, surprised to find her staring at the ground.
What is?
This may be the last evening we gather as a team.
Ehh, c'mon Reva. Don’t say stuff like that. It won't do us any good.
But it is the truth.
Mach, please win tomorrow. I do not want to stop spending time with all of you.
I have been a happier person since I joined this team. I would strongly prefer to stay that way.
Guarded as she is, Reva intones a sadness that the rest of us are trying to deny. Even Jett ceases her march to observe the exchange.
I feel the same way, Reva. I’ll win tomorrow, I promise.
The penalty for lying is death.
Reva breathes out a sigh and collects herself.
I believe that you will.
Me too. Mach probably plays an important part of my story to become the greatest player of all time.
The first chapter can’t end with a loss. It just wouldn’t make sense.
An arm slings itself around my shoulder. With a glance, I find that it belongs to Accel.
Feeling alright?
Not as bad as before, but the pressure is still there.
As your coach, I am obligated to encourage you to win. But what’s most important is what you want.
For what it’s worth, I’m with Reva. I’d be sad to see you leave Korea.
I’ve got more than enough motivation for tomorrow. Is that what we’re here for?
It isn’t just for you.
For the first time first since she barged into my room, Jett addresses me directly. Her expression is devoid of the intensity that I’ve come to know her for.
I wasn’t lying when I said that you had the potential to be great. True as that is, it doesn’t make you special.
Everyone has the capability to be a champion. It isn’t genetic or unique.
I’m not denying the existence of talent. But it's not nearly as essential as people make it out to be. StarCraft—and everything else—is about way more than that.
Most people are either unwilling or unable to work hard. Simply being able to overcome that barrier makes it possible to do things that other people sit around and daydream about.
If you've done that, you can lose without regrets. Have you?
Yeah. I have.
Good. Then all that's left is to trust it'll earn us the win.
Silence follows Jett’s final remarks, leaving us with an air of gravitas. It’s only a quip from Stunt that saves the rest of us from our glum-faced staredown.
Deep.
Don’t be a prick, Stunt.
Alright. Let’s go over the game plan for tomorrow.
How you play is up to you. But it's probably smart to stick to what you've been practicing.
Yeah. I know better than to invent a build on the fly.
How about you open us up, Jett? Still against the build Reva prepared for game one?
I understand the idea, I just don’t think it’s a sure win. Bolt will probably assume Mach is looking to steal a win, so he’ll be on the lookout for something non-standard.
It was devised with that in mind. If executed as planned, it should secure a lead, if not a victory.
Don’t give Bolt any respect that he hasn’t earned. If you let him set the pace for the series, it'll be an uphill battle.
I agree with that, actually.
Alright, fine. It's just not my style of play.
 Moving on, how about mid-game?
Um, I was planning on my usual style. Dropships to establish map control and slow down his third base. If I scout that he’s being too greedy, I go for the kill.
That’s solid. I wouldn’t change anything there.
Seconded. It’s annoying playing against those kind of terrans if I can't kill them early.
Reva fidgets with her glasses, evidently disagreeing.
Do not write off the possibility of mech.
He’s barely practiced mech! Why would you even suggest that?
It is the ideal unit composition when played at its apex.
Only if he can get there safely, which’ll be practically impossible against a protoss as lethal as Bolt.
Reva concedes her suggestion with a shrug.
Last thing. Late game. If Bolt manages to get on three bases, don’t try to end the game in a direct fight unless you have tons of defenses prepared to slow down his march.
The fully-powered protoss army is stronger than a maxed out terran, so you have to look elsewhere to find an edge.
The opposite is true in Brood War, so he's used to being the aggressor. If you see Bolt eager to engage with you, don’t automatically assume it's because he'll roll you.
That reminds me. Are there any other kind of mistakes that Brood War players make when they first switch to StarCraft 2? You and Accel should know better than anyone.
Hm. It’s the little things, honestly. Knowledge that you take for granted that Bolt has to work for.
You can look at five marauders and know they’ll crush seven stalkers without actively thinking about it, for example. He probably can’t yet.
That, and his strategies. Bolt hasn't been playing Star2 for as long as you, so he's probably only up to date on standard builds from the current meta.
He’ll be relying on game sense and mechanics to carry him through that shortcoming. If you can get a read on him, he won't be able to fall back onto an older style.
And as strong a Brood War player as he is, Bolt isn’t immune to slip-ups, especially in a new game. If he expands too fast or spreads his army too thin, crush him.
Yeah. Got it.
Then I guess we’ve done everything we can. Nothing to do but play.
You’ll want to run through some warm-ups and get a glimpse of the crowd early to keep your nerves down, so don’t be late.
When I answer with a nod, Accel smiles.
A final glimpse at the four faces of my teammates underscores the need to win tomorrow. Nothing else needs to be said. Everyone has placed not only their trust, but also their futures in me.
Failure is not an option.
I won’t be in this apartment for much longer.
But I'm going to leave it on my own terms.
How are you feeling, Mach?
Eh?
I blink my eyes and rub them awake. An hour of warm-up at the studio has left me with only fifteen minutes before the match is set to begin.
The powder on my face feels weird. Standard procedure for all broadcasted matches, or so the makeup artist said.
Behind Mr. Kim, a small crowd filters into the stage area. The semi-finals for the Victory StarLeague begins right after the showmatch, so it’s unlikely that everyone is here just to watch me and Bolt play.
But judging by the number of people sporting the black and white colors of Shock T1, there are at least a few.
Oh, Mr. Kim. Sorry. I’m well.
Good. Best of luck in your match. Let’s hope that this is the beginning of a long and fruitful partnership.
I lower my head in a curt bow.
I appreciate it.
Mr. Kim matches my bow with a nod, and then slips around the corner and into the studio.
I’m allowed only a minute of time to myself before the businessman's presence is replaced by Accel's.
Ready?
Yeah. I’m ready.
And I am. I stretch out my wrists and crack my knuckles to emphasize it.
Good. Let’s go.
But before we get into that, we have a special match before the VSTL begins, don’t we?
That’s right. Most of you have likely heard the news that Accel and Jett have left their teams to begin their own.
Regardless of how the fans feel, one must admit that it was quite an ambitious decision.
Certainly! But today we have a match to decide whether those two will have their risk pay off!
A generous prize from Enoch Group has allowed us to host a showmatch between two wildly different players.
A new sponsor! How exciting. On top of that, it’s refreshing to see that KPGA has finally begun to embrace StarCraft 2. How much do we know about the protoss Bolt?
Ah, he’s a very strong player from Shock T1. But this is his first appearance in a StarCraft 2 match, isn’t that right?
We’ll have to see how his Brood War skills translate!
What about his opponent, Mach? Do we know much about him?
There was very little information available about him online, so we must assume that he is an amateur. All the same, he must be quite skilled for Jett and Accel to call him their teammate.
It dawns on me that this match is probably being broadcasted online. Should I have told my parents or friends to tune in and watch?
… No. Enough.
I’m tired of obsessing over acceptance from everyone from back home. This has nothing to do with them.
Now, let’s get the comments from our players. Please welcome, Bolt and Mach!
A production assistant gestures me forward, and I step out onto the stage. Bolt approaches from the other side, standing just a few feet from me when we come to a stop.
He gives a wave, and a few dozen people erupt into cheers. Among them are the screams of at least ten fangirls.
With a microphone in hand, he address the crowd with a charming disposition, completely opposite from every interaction I’ve shared with him.
First, I would like to thank my fans for coming today. I've worked hard to prove that KPGA players will place first in StarCraft 2 championships in the near future.
I’ve always performed well under pressure throughout my pro-gaming career, but today I don't think that I have much to worry about.
The comment draws a few laughs from the audience, KPGA fans and not. He continues.
I am confident that I'll only drop one map today. My opponent's year of StarCraft 2 must have earned him at least one win against my single week.
That’s just an outright lie. But judging by crowd’s reaction, they’re buying it completely.
Foreigners could never compete in Brood War. I'm here to prove that the same is true in StarCraft 2.
I promise to show you all good games. Please cheer for me!
He lifts a fist to another uproar of applause. What a fake piece of shit.
But before I can spend anymore time lingering on how much I dislike Bolt, the VSL hostess takes the mic from him and offers it to me.
Say a few words to your fans. I was told you can speak Korean, correct?
Before I know it, the microphone is in my hand. I try my best not to look bewildered and turn my attention to the audience.
Ehm. Hello. I’m Mach. I want to thank my team for helping me prepare for today's match, and the Enoch Group for sponsoring the showmatch.
I will do my best to win. Thank you.
My earnest approach earns me a polite response from the crowd, though not one that comes close to matching Bolt's.
Please shake hands and go to your booths.
Bolt is first to turn. His smile, no doubt designed and manufactured in an underground KPGA laboratory, belies the edge I see in his eyes.
He offers his hand, and I reach forward to take it for a single shake.
I hope you practiced hard.I am going to destroy you.
I did, don't worry.Not likely. I really, really want to see you lose.
That's good. It would be a shame to disappoint the fans with an uneven series.It doesn't matter what you want. You're trash, and after this you'll never forget it.
Agreed. Let's make sure to show exciting games.Easy to say. Let's see if you can actually do it.
We separate without incident and I turn to take my place in the booth.
Jett stands outside the door with my keyboard, mouse, and mousepad in hand.
What the hell is this?
She drops a keycap into my hand.
Um… I think that’s my Windows key?
It doesn’t belong on a pro-gamer’s keyboard. Fat-fingering that during a battle will tab you out and lose you the game.
She huffs and breaks eye contact. It’s obvious that she’s at least as stressed as I am.
Jett. I’ve got this.
I know. Do your best, Mach. Fighting.
With a nod, she pushes open the booth door.
Once inside, the ambient sound of the stage lights, cameras, and screens die down. All that I can hear is the subtle hum of the crowd and my own pulse.
It would be peaceful, if not for the adrenaline burning through my veins.
This is my first time inside of a booth. My heart is racing, and nothing I try to tell myself as I plug in my peripherals and configure my settings helps to calm it.
Playing in front of a crowd in the VSL has been a goal of mine for more than a year. Even with how hard I've been working, it feels like there should have been more build up to this moment.
Yet, here I am. I reach out to touch the soundproofing material, if only to allow another of my senses to confirm that the moment is real.
Even as I try to keep my focus away from the crowd and on the game, I keep glancing past the computer monitor and towards my teammates seated in the front row.
They wave and cheer at me as the studio lights dim. I force myself to look back at the PC and focus entirely on the match at hand.
Everything I’ve done over the past week… No. The months I’ve been in Korea, and even the time before that. It’s all lead up to this moment.
The second the loading screen ends, I put the plan into action. I rush one of my starting SCVs across the map.
But I'm not sending it to his base.
It comes to a stop on the outskirts of his fourth base location. It's only barely closer to his base than mine, honestly.
But it's close enough to buy me precious seconds.
Reva called this build 'Proxy Everything.'
Depot. Gas. Rax. Reactor. Fac. Starport. I've drilled it to perfection and hit every timing within the second.
Bolt didn't even scout. He'll pay for that mistake.
My dropship rushes straight into his base at a timing that normally wouldn't be possible. Every single one of those extra seconds is precious.
Perfect! I unload my hellions straight into his mineral line. He was completely unprepared!
He tries to escape with his workers, but I'm too quick in giving chase. I'm not letting you get away, Bolt.
My hellions weave past his slow-moving army and deal another blow to his economy. That one must have crippled him.
He remains in the game only as an act of defiance. With my victory assured, I march into his base with an overwhelming force and take a fight on his turf.
Tch. He scrapes together a final defense and actually manages to dent my army, though it's not enough to swing the game back.
Not bad. But game one is mine.
A gentle knock at the door behind me catches my attention while the studio prepares for the next game. A moment later, the door slides open.
Just as planned. Well executed, Mach.
Seriously, where did you of all people come up with a build like that?
Just because I loathe cheese does not mean I will not admit that it is occasionally useful and appropriate.
I guarantee we'll be seeing it on the ladder for the next month.
With luck, they will call it the Mach Build.
Maintain your momentum. Fighting.
She hurries out of the booth and back to her seat in the crowd when I nod. Just as before, the studio lights dim and the second match gets under way.
Phew. Okay, keep it cool. The momentum is in my favor now. I should make use of this breathing room.
I need to find out how Bolt's going to be playing for the rest of the set. He went for a standard expansion last game, but I wasn't able to see his army as intended.
This map is good for two-base play. I should definitely go for drops, but I still need to decide on an opening.
Woah, wait a second! Bolt is proxy-gating me!
God dammit, I didn't even consider the possibilty! I veer my gameplan in a defensive direction, but Bolt's attack is already overwhelming my mineral line.
Even with all the practice I had against Stunt's rushes, there's nothing I can do when caught so offguard. For every step forward I take with SCV and marine micro, Bolt seizes five with damage to my economy.
I can't stay in the game any longer and tap out a gg. Urgh! Just like that, he evened up the series!
I barely have time to take my headphones off before I feel a pair of hands clamp down on my shoulders.
Keep it up!
 Stay in the zone!
 You got this!
Ow. Ow! Okay, enough.
He got really lucky. Scouted your base first, and you only barely missed the probe as it came up your ramp.
C'mon, you've been practicing with the future protoss bonjwa and his macro-battery. The next game is yours for the taking.
Yeah. There's no way I'm letting another proxy get by me.
That's what I'm talking about! FIGHTING!
Alright. Keep it together. There's no way I'll let another proxy get by me.
My scout reveals little information, save that he's going for a one-base tech build. There are several things I need to be prepared for, so I should make sure the front of my base is reinforced.
As long as I keep my army on the ramp, I should be able to respond to any flying units. With each second that ticks by, I pull more and more away with the game.
Just as long as I don't tech too aggressively and focus on maintaining a sizable army, I should be fine.
Huh, did he transition into something more standard? He takes some damage on a scouting stalker before hastily pulling it away.
Was that it? I should probably double check whether or not he's got an expansion down. It might be a good call to throw down a missile turret in my main as well, just as a precaution.
Blink stalkers! Shit, he had vision on my high ground?! Must have been an observer... Argh! Why didn't I see it?!
He's able to pick off several units just as they finish building at my barracks, the numbers advantage heavily on his side.
I empty my bunkers and rush them up my ramp, but he turns my own choke point against me and handily defeats my entire army with some ridiculously precise micro.
I have nothing left to do but gg and accept the fact that I'm now down a game.
Knock knock.
Yo. How are you feeling?
Do you want the polite answer or the honest answer?
You're playing well, but Bolt's been able to sniff out where you're weakest. You need to confront him head-on.
A macro game with a KPGA pro? Is that smart?
Hey, no one ever said that StarCraft was an easy game.
We practice long hours for the moments like this. Show the crowd how hard you've been working.
... Alright. I won't go down without a fight.
Good. Fighting.
There's no way I'm giving up now. I've already proven to myself that I can beat this guy.
Forget the score. Focus on the game.
This map is huge, but I opt for a conservative timing on my expansion. Bolt's shown a serious proclivity towards aggressive play.
My scout reveals that we're on equal footing. Alright, time to drop the hammer.
My first drop manages to catch him with his army out of position. Perfect.
He has to be rushing back to defend against this drop. With that knowledge, I rush a second, smaller force into his third base.
Tch, he held firm! The second prong of my attack slams right into an overwhelming force. It's too late for me to pull away.
Agh, that wasn't his entire army?! The damage I managed to inflict wasn't nearly worth the cost of those two forces...
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.
I still have a decent army, I just need to contest the center of the map. I can't let him take another base.
ARGH! But he's already beat me to the punch! We clash briefly before I order a retreat, frantically reinforcing my wounded army.
I can't fall behind. Take more bases, keep my production going!
C'mon! I've got to deal some damage. If I just sit here and let him power up, he's going to roll me!
Boom! Stalkers! This kind of pick-off is just what I needed!
Shit, he's preparing an assault on my main! Pull back, pull back! I can defend this!
Just before his forces arrive, I get in position at the top of my ramp. It's looking even for a while, until...
Boom! HAH! This is the type of error a Brood War player makes! The burden to attack was mine, not his.
This game's tempo is back in my favor, even if I'm still at an economic disadvantage. I need to hit while he's still rebuilding.
Gotcha! The mineral line I failed to take down with my previous drop now lies in tatters.
And this time, my two-pronged attack catches a weak flank defending his third base! I'm pulling him apart!
I'm inflicting crushing economic damage. All I need to do is win one more fight.
I'm spending my minerals and gas the second I mine it. My production has been on point all game long.
There's absolutely no way this would have been possible without drilling for so many hours.
One more fight. Just one more fight! I march across the map and then charge up the ramp at his natural expansion.
I maneuver out of the way out his psi storms and pound the powerful, expensive units at the back of his army. With them all out of the way, I'm able to power through the rest of his force.
Yes! He types out a GG when I punch my way into his main base. The series is even!
My hands shake. The veins in my neck throb. My palms are covered with sweat.
My throat is dry. My eyes hurt. And I can't stop bouncing my leg.
Will you calm down? Sheesh.
I don't think that's going to be possible.
Tch. Typical amateur jitters. Don't try to ignore that adrenaline you're feeling—use it to your advantage.
What else do you want me to say? You already know what to do.
I don't know. Honestly, I didn't give any thought to how I'd feel if I made it this far. I kinda feel like throwing up, actually.
In that case, just imagine how sick you'll be when you win this thing.
In more ways than one.
Alright, enough chit-chat. Get serious, Mach.
Fighting.
Stay calm. Just one more.
Cross off that checklist. Depots. Rax. Expand.
A stalker denies my scout at the front of his natural expansion. Tch, that's frustrating.
Without knowing the timing on his second base, it's unsure of how much damage I need to do. When my dropships come out, I need to find a good angle to attack him from. Let's see...
... Woah. What? Six gates and a robo this early? How is that possible? That literally isn't possible.
But I'm forced to witness the reality of the situation march across the map. His army is ridiculously huge.
This is insane. He faked an expansion and intentionally delayed his one-base attack to catch me offguard.
I... simply do not have enough units to defend against his army. I won't for another minute, either.
By then, the game will be over.
I'm going to lose.
No! I don't need to take a direct engagement to win against Bolt!
It's time for a base trade.
With my entire army loaded in four dropships, I sprint across the map and unload into his base.
Bolt has two options. One: Pull back his army and suffer serious damage in the meantime or, two, rush into my base and do the same as I'm doing to him.
He opts for number two. Alright. I've been in these kind of situations before. This kind of game is far less about macro, micro, or anything like that. It's all about staying calm and making the right decisions.
I'm okay. His army is big, but mine is fast. I just need to focus on hunting his buildings down.
We trade building for building, the remnants of my main base unable to get away from his massive force.
Found another pylon! If I keep this up, I can put him in an unwinnable situation.
All he has left is a single pylon, the one he used to reinforce his attack.
Just before my final building bursts in the flames, I throw down a supply depot in a corner of the map guarded by terrain and distance.
If he wants to win, he'll have to abandon his final pylon. It's looking like this game might end up as a draw.
I'm about to ask if he wants the tie when I notice something in the corner of my eye.
.... WOAH. He just pulled a significant part of his army away from his pylon! He's destroying the rock barrier!
Shit! SHIT! I'm not in position to defend my final building! Not like this, god!
I have to beat him to it. Go. GO!
All is slow and silent. My heart thunders against my ribcage. I can feel the blood roaring through my veins.
A second later, I rip my headphones off and scream in triumph. 
This high... I’ve never felt anything like it. All the effort and hardship I’ve poured into the twenty years of my life. This one moment is worth it all.
With a thump, Jett bursts through the booth's door and pounds my back with claps between her own cheers.
She’s soon joined by the rest of my team who follow suit, sharing in my victory.
No, not my victory. Our victory.
With some prodding from Accel, we collect ourselves and step out onto the stage to show our gratitude to the crowd with waves and smiles.
But before the VSL hostess can cross the stage for a post-game interview, Bolt emerges from his booth with a macabre expression splattered across his face.
He wrenches the microphone from the hostess' hand and points at me from the other side of the stage.
Savor that win, you piece of shit. It’s the last you’ll ever have against me.
The crowd reacts with a mixture of astonishment and encouragement, the latter coming mainly from the fans dressed in Shock T1’s black and white.
Emboldened by my failure to respond, he continues.
The current StarCraft 2 pro-gamers pool disgraces eSports. I pledge to my fans that I will expose these frauds for what they are.
I hereby announce my retirement from Brood War.
I am immediately going full-time with StarCraft 2 with the intent to take the VSL Championship on behalf of those that deserve the honor of calling themselves professional gamers.
With that, Bolt slams the microphone against the ground, causing its plastic shell to fracture and a loud screech to emit from the speakers.
He stalks off stage and through the players’ exit without another word, trailed by the stares of his fans.
Woah. There’s no way that was a part of the KPGA’s plan.
That guy really likes to break electronics, huh? I wonder how many keyboards he’s been through.
I share a baffled look with Jett before the VSL hostess picks up what remains of the microphone and steps to my side. My teammates take it as a cue to vacate the stage.
The post-game interview is short and formal, with half of the crowd completely unresponsive to my attempt to show good sportsmanship.
Either they’re on Bolt's side, or they're impatient to see the VSTL get started.
Still, a handful of people cheer me off the stage as the studio begins to set up for team league. 
Among them is a familiar wisp of grey hair. But when I search for the face to whom it belongs, I don't see who I'm looking for.
To my utter surprise, a trio of foreigners approach backstage with autograph requests. I oblige them nervously, unfamiliar with how to properly sign the mousepads they hand me.
Thanks man!
Yeah, thanks!
You rock!
I scratch behind my head when they head off, surprised and humbled.
Not a bad start, Mach.
I turn to find Jett watching me from across the room. She pushes off the wall and ambles toward me.
And. Uh. For the record, I’m sorry that I hit you.
It might have been what I needed. There’s no hard feelings.
It wasn't right. There was probably a better option.
It’s in the past. Seriously.
She smiles genuinely, far wider than I've ever seen from her before.
You’ll make a good teammate.
A sudden clap purges the expression from her face. Just like that, it’s back to the intense Jett that I’m much better acquainted with.
Alright, enough backpatting. Back to the team, we’ve got places to be.
Without bothering to answer my curious look, she rolls her wrist in a beckoning motion and leads me out into the hallway of the VSL studio.
It’s crowded, with even more people pouring into the studio in anticipation of the semi-final team league match.
But off away from the foot traffic, we find Mr. Kim with Accel, Stunt and Reva.
He turns to regard Jett and then me with a smile, restrained in comparison to my teammates.
And the victor arrives. Congratulations, Mach.
I lower my head in a bow without taking my eyes off of him.
Thank you.
I’ll send word for my assistant to publish a press release. The sponsorship should be no surprise given how quickly this type of information spreads, but it should be a nice PR boost for Enoch Red.
... Alright, I’ll admit. That’s a pretty good name.
Mm. I’ll leave the rest to Jett. I expect great things from you five.
When Mr. Kim turns to leave, Reva, Stunt and I probe Jett with looks.
The rest?
It’ll be easier for me to show than to explain. C’mon, it’s not far.
I fall in line behind Stunt and Accel after Jett takes off, stepping in time with Reva at my side. She leans towards me with an offered smile.
Congratulations. You avoided the death penalty.
Yeah. Now instead of dying an instant death, I die a slow one at the hands of a Korean practice regimen.
Oh. In that case, it is not too late.
She gently chops the back of my neck. I feign decapitation and then straighten back up to meet her smile.
... This one.
She tests the key against the lock only to find that it doesn’t fit.
No, wait. This one.
We retrace our steps back down the apartment building’s hallway to a door we passed earlier. She tries the key and, again, it doesn't fit.
Are we on the wrong floor?
No! Will you just... Wait. Oh, it's the one across the hall.
This time, the key slides into the lock and then turns, revealing a mostly unfurnished room.
It’s small, and it’s not in a great part of town. But I can’t deny the pride welling up inside of me as I step inside, shoulder to shoulder with my teammates.
We spread out instinctively, looking over the plain floors and countertops as if we were inspecting a mansion.
How'd you get this so quickly?
It was a good deal, but they wanted the deposit more than a week ago. Someone else was trying to snatch it out from under us.
You put money down on our team house without knowing whether or not I’d win against Bolt?
Jett dodges the question by glancing away, leaving Accel to swoop in and fill the silence.
Nice having a team that believes in you, eh? That’s not all, by the way.
He gestures towards a lonely cardboard box off in the corner of the room.
Stunt, I think you should have the honor.
Somehow, Stunt has found the time during this monumental occasion to pull out his phone.
But, as instructed, he makes his way to the corner of the room and peels back the box’s lid.
What follows is a sound of unbridled joy.
HEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL YEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
He rummages around in the box’s contents before pulling free a red and white jacket.
One by one, Stunt practically rips them free and tosses them towards the four of us.
I catch mine and, on closer inspection, find the Enoch Red logo on the back.
Jett’s expression is too neutral to be authentic. I think it’s simply that she has a hard time admitting that she had faith all along.
Knowing that makes me happy, so I have no reason to press her on it.
YO! IT’S TIME TO CELEBRATE!
You got your chance to celebrate a week ago! Now is time to practice.
Oh how easily Jett breaks herself out of her quiet trance when the chance to play empress arrives.
Pft, how? There’s like two PCs here! C’mon, last time before we’re VSL champs. I swear.
I'm with the kid.
I concur.
